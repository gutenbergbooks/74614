<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<hr class="tiny">

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the preparation of the following Work the Author
has to acknowledge the assistance which he has received
from a Japanese gentleman in Yokohama, whose name,
for obvious reasons, it is prudent not to mention.</p>

<p>With his knowledge of the history and institutions
of his country, the Author was able to fill up the
blanks in short notices of history contained in elementary
Japanese books. He was further enabled to go
over the red-books of the empire, which enter into the
details of the pedigrees of illustrious families, and into
the minutiæ of Government offices.</p>

<p>The supposed unalterable character of these institutions
induces those who have any pretensions to learning
in China and Japan to master and retain by memory
the names and duties of the different offices in the
various departments of Government; and they are frequently
found to be good authorities upon questions
upon which there is no published information.</p>

<p>In the history of the intercourse of the Jesuits with
Japan, the letters of the fathers have been almost the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
only authorities relied upon; while in the more recent
events contemporary publications have been used.</p>

<p>In taking notes from the conversation of a Japanese
who could speak but little English, in too many
cases they were written down in what is known in
China as “pigeon English”; and the Author has to
acknowledge and regret that in many cases the cramped
nature of the notes has not been entirely removed, and
for such instances he craves the indulgence of the
reader.</p>

<small>THE IMPERIAL FAMILY AND COURT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span>, in the earlier periods of his existence, when he was
as yet putting forth his juvenile strength to subdue creation,
was ever inclined to look upon the great forces of nature as
difficulties in his path and obstacles to his progress, which,
in his more mature strength, he has come to regard as aids
to help him, and to cherish as the very means to the attainment
of his ends. Such an object of awe to the earlier
mariner was the great ocean, when he had no compass to
guide him over its unknown and apparently boundless expanse,
and with no knowledge of the winds and no experience
of the currents. When he had no means of keeping
food or fresh water for any great length of time, he was a
bold man who would venture far out of sight of land. Provided
with the faithful compass, men became bolder; they
enlarged their vessels, making longer voyages, until they ran
over the length and breadth of the Eastern seas. Still the
China Sea, with its typhoons and its monsoons and currents,
down to a comparatively recent period, was looked upon as
an obstacle which was to be smoothed down and not to be
wrestled with. To beat up the China Sea against the northeastern
monsoon was considered a rash struggle and a fool
hardy waste of time, and in consequence the trade-voyages
to China were confined to vessels going up the sea in summer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
with the southerly monsoon and returning in winter
with the northerly. Obstacles such as these made mariners
unwilling to run the risk of pushing up the sea the length
of Shanghai or Japan, when the time of their return was
a matter of so much doubt.</p>

<p>In the present age, when man is thinking himself of some
importance from the little odds and ends of knowledge he
has stored up, the ocean, instead of being a barrier of separation
between islands and continents, has become what the
Mediterranean Sea was to the Old World—a link of connection,
a highway of commerce, and steam has become a bridge
by which distant shores have been joined together. The
world is now finding out that she is one—that the interests of
nations are one, and that no one part of the body can say to
the other, “I have no need of thee.” If Japan has hitherto
felt herself in a position to use such an expression to her
fellow-members of the body cosmopolitan, and the feeling
has been responded to by their acquiescence, the time and
circumstances seem to have arrived when this seclusion is to
be ended. The distance at which these islands seemed to lie
from the heart of the world’s circulation, Europe, has been
almost annihilated, and European nations have through the
settlements in India and China crept up alongside of the isles
of the East. The difficulties of access have been smoothed
away, her sumptuary laws have been abrogated, while the
produce of her rich soil is daily increasing to meet the demands
which are made upon it, and which she is becoming
willing and ready to exchange for that of which she is more
in need.</p>

<p>Steam has been the active agent in bringing about these
changes, causing the pulses of trade to beat with greater
frequency and with increased vigor. But to any one who
looks below the surface there may be seen other agents at
work, all concurring at this crisis in the world’s existence to
produce changes of portentous magnitude. The discoveries
of chemistry, whether by the aggressive forces obtained in
the manufacture of munitions of war, or by the more widely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
extended but silent beneficial operations of such an agent as
quinine, steam with all its ramifications of wealth, the telegraph
with its tenfold power of convertibility, the discovery
of gold at the most remote parts of the world, have combined
to produce, by the sudden influx of real wealth, by the intermingling
of ranks of men, and by the rapid throwing into
men’s minds of a quantity of information or of knowledge,
a condition of things in the mass which makes that mass
kneadable by those who can knead it, and fitted for the
reception of any leaven, for good or for evil, which may be
mixed with it. The mingling of ranks in the social system,
the disturbance of creeds in the religious, the confounding
of parties in the political, are preparing the way for some
world-wide change, by which old systems are to be done
away and new established. It is not working in one nation
alone, but in all: it is not confined to Christendom, showing
that the time to come is not to be like times past; but that
the time is coming when it is possible for one person to aim
at one rule over the whole world. This change is coming
up like the rising of water. It may overwhelm all existing
things like a wave. Some call it Progress, others Democracy,
but, whatever it be, it is evident that every existing
institution is to get such a shaking that only the things that
cannot be shaken will stand.</p>

<p>All national institutions having, or pretending to have,
order, will probably have to undergo this trial; and when it
comes the whole remains of the feudal system will be tested:
monarchies, the peerage, tenures of land, orders in the
Church, and, above all, the question of primogeniture, cannot
fail to be put on trial. The different sections in the
religious and political world seem gradually separating themselves
into two large parties, the one standing for the <i>vox
Dei</i>, the other holding the <i>vox populi</i> to be the <i>vox Dei</i>—the
one believing that power comes from above, the other
that power comes from below.</p>

<p>The leaven is working in the minds of men, whether
they will it or not; and no nation will feel the effects of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
fermentation more than Japan. Above all nations, she to
this hour retains her feudal system intact. She must learn,
as others have in past times and may have to learn again,
at the expense of revolution and blood. The people are
already being stirred, and dare to question. The nobles
are beginning to quake, they know not why, in the face
of changes which are being forced upon them. The very
throne of the emperor is being searched and shaken.</p>

<p>In order to understand where the weakness of a building
lies, or how it is likely to fall down, it is first necessary to
know how it is constructed; and in order to comprehend the
changes which events may bring about in Japan, some idea
must be formed of the government of the country. Without
some knowledge of the framework of the constitution, it is
difficult to understand the relative position of men, or to
appreciate the operation of external agents upon the system
of the empire, whether that operation work by a slow process
of leavening from within, or by a violent concussion from
without.</p>

<p>The aim of the author in the following pages has been to
give some idea of the framework of the constitution of Japan.
Having resided for some little time in the country, he was
enabled to get what seemed to him a clearer glimpse of the
working of the different parts of the machinery of State than
was to be gained from any of the able works published on
the subject. The time at his command was too short, and
his knowledge of the language too limited, to enable him to
do more than prepare a sketch which may serve a temporary
purpose, before works of greater research and fuller information
are produced.</p>

<p>The position of the Emperor (Spiritual Emperor, as he is
sometimes erroneously called), as the first in the empire,
must be recognized; the office held by the Temporal Emperor,
the Shiogoon (or Tycoon, as he has been named), must
be correctly and distinctly understood before the nature of
the rule in the empire can be comprehended. It is further
essential that the student should be acquainted with the rank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
and position of the nobility or nobilities of the empire (for of
these there are two classes)—that of Miako at the court of
the Emperor, the Koongays; and that of Yedo at the court
of the Shiogoon, the Daimio, and beneath them the Hattamoto.
Without some knowledge of these the reader is lost
in a maze of unmeaning names and titles; but with a slight
acquaintance with the rank, offices, and names of these
nobles, he is able not only to follow the thread of history,
but to understand the intricacies of current events.</p>

<p>A description of a picture by a native artist, seen by the
author of this volume, may give some idea of the relation in
which these dignitaries stand the one to the other. The
upper half of the picture represents the Shiogoon or Tycoon
at the palace in the capital, Miako, making his obeisance and
performing homage before his liege lord the Emperor, seated
in the great hall, Shi shin den, of the palace. The upper
part of the Emperor’s person is concealed behind a screen of
thin slips of bamboo hanging from the roof. The throne is
three mats, or thin mattresses, placed one above the other
upon the floor. There is no chair or support to the back.
On each side of the Emperor sit on their knees on the floor
the high officers of his court. Before him is seen the late
Shiogoon, kneeling and prostrating himself, with his head
to the floor. Behind the Shiogoon are his high officers Stotsbashi
and the great Daimio Owarri, both in a similar position
of prostration; while beneath, in the open court, are military
officials of the Imperial Court standing or kneeling. This
picture represents accurately a fact, and what appears to be
a correct illustration of the ideas of the people of Japan with
regard to the relative status of the Emperor and the Shiogoon.</p>

<p>It may almost be a matter of wonder that so little was
known of Japan until the advent of the Portuguese. Men
were in old times adventurous travelers, and yet, except what
is contained in the pages of Marco Polo, written in the thirteenth
century, nothing more was known of the existence of
the country. The Buddhism of India had permeated China,
Corea, and Japan, but it brought nothing back. Mohammedanism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
at an early stage, reached China, and gained
many converts, and the Arabs carried on an extensive trade
with China and the Eastern Isles; but neither by their writings
nor by the early native accounts do they seem to have
reached the shores of Japan, or, at least, ever to have returned
from them. This may perhaps be attributed to the
wars of the Crusades, which appear to have lighted up such
a fierce feeling between the Christian and the Moslem as to
have proved a barrier to the inquisitiveness of the former
in his investigations regarding the East. When the Portuguese,
in the beginning of the sixteenth century, had pushed
their discoveries and trade as far as Malacca, and thence to
China, it was to be expected that such adventurous seamen
as they then were would, before long, solve the question of
a people living under the rising sun. It is fortunate that,
among the lawless buccaneers and pirates, as they evidently
were, on those seas during this time, one man, Mendez Pinto,
should have been found with the zeal to write some account
of the doings on the Sea of China, and to lift the veil which,
until he wrote, hung over the events which he records. That
the latter part of his narrative, relating principally to China,
should have been called mendacious, is not to be wondered
at. But all that he relates with reference to Japan is not
only corroborated by a closer acquaintance with the country
and people, but also by the native historians in their accounts
of the arrival of foreigners in the country, as well as
by the letters of the Jesuits who visited Japan very shortly
after it was first discovered by the Portuguese traders.</p>

<p>Subsequently to the period at which Mendez Pinto wrote,
the history of foreign relations with the country is kept up
by the letters of priests and Jesuits who occupied Japan as
a field for the spread of Christianity. In the “Histoire de
l’Église du Japon” there is an excellent summary of occurrences
connected with the Church, its missions, its successes,
its difficulties, its martyrs, and its enemies, together with a
glance at events in Japan during the most eventful crisis in
the history of the country. After the expulsion of the Jesuits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
and Roman Catholic doctrines from the empire, there are
accounts from time to time published by the officers connected
with the establishment kept up by Holland at Nagasaki.
Caron, Fischer, Meylan—but, above all, Kæmpfer
and Thunberg, and Titsingh and Klaproth—and, in our
own times, Siebold—have done much to elucidate the manners
and customs and natural history of Japan.</p>

<p>Kæmpfer has given a most interesting and instructive
account of what he saw in the country during a long residence,
and upon more than one progress to the courts at
Miako and Yedo. His delineation of the manners and customs
of the people of Japan will remain as a memorial of a
state of things seen under circumstances not likely to occur
again. But the work was published by another after the
death of the author, and, in consequence of this, many of
the names of men, places and things are nearly unintelligible.
Kæmpfer’s work is well known to the Japanese, having
been translated or repeatedly copied in manuscript, and
is known as “Su koku rong.” It is an interdicted book, and
only recently a man was punished upon being detected in
the act of copying the translation. The translation by Klaproth
of the “Annales des Empereurs de Japon” is a most
valuable work, and contains a wonderful amount of information,
being, as it were, the complement of Kæmpfer’s
work, drawn entirely from books and not from personal
observation.</p>

<p>The natives of Japan appear to have an intense love and
reverence for their own country, and every individual in the
empire seems to have a deep and thorough appreciation of
the natural beauties and delights of the country. To this
the genial climate, the rich soil, and the variety of the surface
contribute. The islands lie at such a latitude as to
make the air in summer warm without being hot, and in
winter cold without being raw. The soil, as in all recent
lava soils, is of a rich black mould, raising the finest crops
of millet, wheat and sugar-cane, and when supplied in unstinted
profusion rearing splendid timber, or capable, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
nearly entirely withdrawn, of keeping life and vigor and
seeding power in a pine tree of two inches in height. The
trees have a tendency to break out into excrescences from
plethora. The variety of surface arises from the great
height to which the mountains rise in an island which at
no part presents so great a breadth as England, and yet
slopes gradually from the mountain tops to the sea. Some
of these ridges appear to rise to the height of Mont Blanc,
one of them, Fusiyama, being upward of thirteen thousand
feet in height, and it would appear that other ranges are
higher. The great beauty of Fusi (<i>pah rh</i>, not two) consists
in its rising singly out of a low country with a beautifully
curved sweep to a conical apex; and the atmospheric effects
changing from hour to hour, as it is seen from thirteen
provinces, give such a variety to this single object that it
is rightly called by a name to express the feeling that there
are not two such in the world. The variations of atmospheric
density make it look at one time much higher than at
another. It may be seen with its head clear in the blue sky
rising out of a thick base of clouds—or the clouds rise and
roll in masses about the middle, leaving the gentle curve to
be filled up by the mind’s eye from the base to the apex.
Again, the whole contour, in a sort of proud, queenly sweep,
stands out against a cloudless ether, or with a little vapor
drifting to leeward of the summit giving the appearance
of a crater—or, after a cool night in September, the eye is
arrested by the appearance of the bursting downward of a
flattened shell, the pure white snow filling the valleys from
the top, the haze of the morning half concealing the hill beneath.
Every hour brings a change upon a landscape which
consists of a single object which the lover of nature can
never weary of admiring, in a climate where seventy miles of
atmosphere does not obscure the larger features on the face
of the mountain even to the naked eye. How often would
such an object be visible in the climate of England?</p>

<p>The first settlement of inhabitants upon an island is always
a subject of interesting speculation and inquiry. The insular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
position gives an idea of a definite time or period at which
the peopling of a large island must have taken place. The
freedom of possession of boundless wealth presents every inducement
to the immigrant to remain, while distance and
difficulties repel the idea of return. In Japan this immigration
may in all probability have commenced by a gradual
spreading from the north of inhabitants of Manchuria
through the islands of Saghalien and Jezo to those of the
Japanese group.</p>

<p>During the earlier periods of a nation’s existence, the art
of writing has been generally kept in the hands of men who
have devoted themselves to a life of retirement and seclusion
from the strife and temptations of the outer world.
These have been found among the priesthood, and it has
been their business or their amusement to gather up and
commit to writing what had been up to the time current as
oral tradition in regard to prehistoric occurrences. Men are
forced by reasoning to refer the appearance of their first ancestors
to a creation by, or procession from, a Divine Being.
At the same time, those who have wielded the power of
writing, and thereby reached and influenced a larger circle
of their fellowmen, have generally endeavored to clothe the
deities from whom they profess to have sprung with virtues
which were to be emulated by their descendants, or to inculcate
through them, by precept, a purity of moral conduct to
be practiced by their followers.</p>

<p>The group of islands generally included under the one
name Japan was known in remote times by a variety of
names—“Akitsu sima, Toyo aki, Toyo ashiwarra no nakatsa
kooni.” “Wo kwo,” the country of peace, is used by the
Chinese for Japan. “Ho,” pronounced “Yamato,” and
used for one province, is frequently applied in Japan to
the whole country.</p>

<p>The name Nippon—Nits pon—“Yutpone” in Cantonese,
“Jih pun” in the Mandarin dialect, by which the whole empire
is now known—is of Chinese origin, and has probably
been conveyed to the country by the first Chinese settlers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
Denoting, as the name implies, that it is the country where
the sun rises, the idea must have originated with the people
to the west. “Hon cho,” another name by which it is
known, conveys the same idea, “The beginning or root of
the morning.” The name “Yamato,” peaceful, harmonious,
was more likely to have originated with the natives.
“Akitsu sima” implies that the island resembles a dragonfly
in shape, and was at first applied to Kiusiu alone. “Shin
koku,” a name by which the Japanese speak of their own
empire, means the land of spirits; and a similar idea is conveyed
by the name “Kami no kooni.” “Awadsi sima” refers
to the supposed origin of the islands from mud or froth,
and is still applied to the large island lying between Nippon
and Sikok.</p>

<p>Some of these names probably retain the old words used
by the original inhabitants of the country translated into
Chinese by the new immigrants. To these newcomers it
was no doubt a work of pleasure to gather up what stores of
tradition were floating among the inhabitants of the country,
and, adding thereto much from their own imagination, to
compose a mythology suited to the genius of the people.
This mythology, which we may suppose to have been composed
by some of the Chinese <i>literati</i> about the court, had
for its object the elevation of the reigning family, and the
assertion for that family of a divine origin and divine ancestry.
It is worthy of note that these divine ancestors were
known at a very early period by Chinese names, that of the
mother and founder of the imperial family being “Ten sho
dai jin”—the “great spirit of the celestial splendor of the
sun,” four distinct Chinese words.</p>

<p>According to this mythology, the heavens and the earth
having formed themselves out of nothing, gave forth a spirit—a
“kami”—who was the father of a line of seven generations
of spiritual beings who ruled the universe as it then
was, during a period extending over millions of years, ending
in a male and a female, respectively named Issanaghi
and Issanami. These seem equivalents to or representatives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
of the male and the female principles which, according to
the Chinese, pervade all animate creation. They are allegorically
represented as producing the islands of Japan, the
mountains, seas and other natural objects therein. Subsequently
a daughter was brought forth, “Ten sho dai jin,”
who is the spirit of the sun; and another, “Tsuki no kami,”
the spirit of the moon. These divinities are of no further
importance in history than as serving to make a line of ancestry
for the reigning family. At the time when, according
to tradition, the genealogy merged in mortal men, the country
was found to be peopled, and there is no attempt to
show whence these people came, though described as hairy,
uncivilized, and living in the open air. These myths are
generally of a Buddhistic origin, and were probably brought
over or invented by some missionary of that religion at an
early time, when the influence of India operated strongly in
the spread of its doctrines. This influence is shown to this
day in the repetition of prayers in an unknown language,
and the retention of an Indian alphabet and writing—the
Sanskrit or Devanagari—in all the religious works of Japan.</p>

<p>Some of these divinities are so frequently heard of, and
representations of them, in pictures and carvings, are so
common, that even a slight acquaintance with their names
and attributes is useful. The different Buddhas are worshiped;
Compera; the five hundred “Rakhan” or “Lohon”;
the “Kwanon,” or goddess of mercy; and the “Stchi fuku
jing,” or seven gods of riches. These last are generally
drawn or carved on a boat, with emblems around them of
long life, etc.—the stork, tortoise, a deer, a bag of money,
a fir-tree, a bamboo, a crystal ball, a fish. Their names are—Hotay
Daikoku, Yaybissu, Benten, Gayho, Bistamong,
Fukowo kojiu. But the religion is more or less pantheistic,
and there are many other gods and divinities, even down to
shapeless stones.</p>

<p>To “Ten sho dai jin” is attributed the origin of the imperial
house, as is shown by the words of the Emperor, in a
letter recently written on the political position of affairs, “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
am grieved, standing as I do between ‘Ten sho dai jin’ and
my people.”</p>

<p>In the fifth generation after “Ten sho dai jin,” was born
“Zinmu” or “Jin mu” (Chin: Shinwu—<i>i.e.</i>, spirit of war).
He was the first of the earthly or human rulers. He is said
to have been born in Fiuga, a mountainous province on the
east side of Kiu siu, on the west coast of the Boo ngo Channel.
This part of the islands is well suited for trading purposes,
and it is also well adapted for the landing of an
invading force, and it is not unlikely that Zinmu either
originally came from China, or was the son of some Chinese
who had settled there, and who started thence on a
design of conquest. At the time when he set out upon his
career, the people of the country are said to have been hairy
and uncivilized, but under the rule of a headman in each
village. The Japanese have to this day a great contempt
for the people of Yezo, who may be thus described, and they
allege that similar tribes occupied the whole of the islands,
and that they were gradually driven back before the armies
of Zinmu. It is more likely that they were conquered, and
gradually amalgamated with their conquerors by the intermarriage
of these with native females, and that in this way,
and by the effects of the warm climate of the south, they
lost that hirsute appearance which is so characteristic of the
people of Yezo.—Aino, the name given to the hairy inhabitants
of Yezo by the Japanese, means “between,” and has
reference to a contemptuous idea of the origin of these people
from a dog.—There are two strongly-marked varieties of
feature in Japan, which are always strikingly portrayed in
their own pictures. There is the broad flat face of the lower
classes, and the high nose and oval face of the higher. The
difference is so marked as to be some argument in favor of
a previous mixing of two different races; the one of which
had extended southward from the Kurile Islands and Siberia,
hairy and broad-featured; while the other had originated
from the south, with Indian features and smooth skins.</p>

<p>The Japanese themselves do not pretend that there is any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
native documentary evidence in support of their history at
the date of Zinmu, and the best writers allow that no writings
prior to the seventh century are authentic. The introduction
of Chinese letters into Japan is generally attributed
to Onin, a learned man who came from Corea about the
year 285 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> But prior to the date of Onin, many of the
names of offices and officers were Chinese. It is hardly
credible that, with the communication which is known to
have existed at different times between Japan and China,
and also with Corea, there should have continued for so
long a time such complete ignorance. More than one embassy
had resided at the court of China for months. The
Chinese annals speak of an embassy during the reign of
the Han dynasty, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 238, when China was divided into
“three kingdoms.” The ruler of Woo, one of these three,
proposed to invade Japan, but the expedition miscarried.
Nearly two centuries before this, in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 57, an embassy
was sent from Japan to China by Sei nin, which arrived at
the court of Kwang ou, of the Eastern Han dynasty, in the
last year of his reign. It is unlikely that, residing as such
an embassy must have done for a considerable time at the
court of China, they should not have brought away some
knowledge of letters or some instructors in reading and
writing. This Corean, Onin, may have been brought over
to replace or to reteach what had been lost: for in more
recent times it is known that, after the long civil wars of
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, so little attention had
been given to the instruction of youth that only two men
were found in the empire competent to teach the written
language.</p>

<p>We may be permitted to believe that much of what became
tradition had at one time been committed to writing,
and that, corroborated as it is at some points by Chinese history,
there is a foundation for much of that part of history
subsequent to the time of Zinmu, for the support of which
there existed, when writing recommenced, no documentary
evidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span></p>

<h3>THE EMPEROR OF JAPAN</h3>

<p>The line of gods carried on through godlike mortal descendants
was prolonged in ordinary mortals, the first of
whom was Zinmu. It is of little consequence by whom this
pedigree was written or invented. It evidently was solely
written for the then <i>de facto</i> rulers of the land. It does not
pretend to deal with the people of Japan, or with the mode
in which the peopling of the empire took place, but simply
invents and details a divine pedigree for one family. At
the time when this family is first heard of, the islands of
Japan are acknowledged by Japanese historians to have
been already peopled and divided into villages, each under
some municipal rule.</p>

<p>The reign of Zinmu is the era of Japan, and is placed
at 667 years before Christ. Setting out from Miazaki in
Fiuga, on the east side of the island of Kiusiu, he with
troops under his command gradually overran that island,
and the adjoining one of Sikok, together with the west half
of the island of Nippon, as far as the province of Mino to the
east of Miako. Coming from the most rugged and comparatively
barren province in the empire, he was attracted by
the beauty and desirableness of the country around Miako.
He settled at a place named Kashiwarra or Kashiwabarra,
a site near the city of Narra, about fifteen miles from the
present capital. This choice of a site has been ratified by
every succeeding emperor, the Kio or capital (“King,” Chinese)
of the empire having been frequently changed, but
never removed to any great distance from the spot originally
selected by Zinmu.</p>

<p>In truth, the site is in every way most suitable for the
capital of the country. It is, geographically, nearly in the
center of the islands which constitute the empire. From
the port of the capital, Osaka (or Naniwa, as it was named
of old), a great fringe of the coast of the three islands in
almost land-locked waters is accessible to ships without their
venturing into the open sea. To this port a large body of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
water is rolled down by the confluence of several rivers,
which at one time were dispersed into several mouths and
branches; but by labor these have been collected and confined
within two outlets. There is, in consequence, a large
extent of alluvial ground producing rice and wheat for a
numerous population. The inland water-communication extends
to the large lake Owomi—upward of sixty miles in
length and eighteen in breadth; and thence, with an interval
of a few miles only of land-carriage, to the port of Tsurunga,
on the northern coast; while to the southeast, the
natives report that there is uninterrupted water-communication
to Owarri, and thence to Sinano, and, with a short interval
of land-carriage, even to Yedo—whence, again, it
extends northward by rivers and canals to the vicinity of
Nambu. The city of Miako of the present day stands on
a plain, among hills clothed with wood, where art has done
what it could to assist nature in the completion of landscape
scenery, of the beauties of which the natives speak with rapture.
During twenty-four centuries, members of the family
of Zinmu have sat upon the throne, and during that long
time the palace has been only at short intervals removed to
any considerable distance from the site on which it at present
stands.</p>

<p>The imperial residence in Japan is a very different structure
from anything that European ideas of palaces would
expect, being chiefly built of wood and other materials so
inflammable that a palace has been reconstructed and destroyed
within a year. When we read of each emperor, at
an early date, building a palace for himself, it is not to be
supposed that these were either expensive or very durable
buildings. Each emperor seems to have occupied a different
habitation from his predecessor, removing from one site
to another, but generally keeping within the province of
Yamashiro, or that adjoining, Yamato. Kwanmu, in the
year 794, built a palace on the site where the present city
stands, and since his time Miako has been always looked
upon as the metropolis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>The palace of the Emperor of Japan is called, as a whole,
“Kinri go sho.” Though built of fine and expensive timber,
it presents no appearance of that outward splendor which is
generally considered by us to be necessary to an imperial
residence. The roofs of the buildings are said to be white.
It is surrounded by a common inclosure of wooden boarding.
This inclosure is pierced by several gates. These entrances
are graduated, and the settlement of the gate by which a
great man shall make his entrance or his exit is a matter of
no small importance at court. These gates lead into a large
open space; in this is another inclosure (with other gates),
in the center of which stands the wooden building, the “Shi
shin deng,” or imperial office, in which the emperor receives
the highest officers of the empire. This he appears to do
almost in the open air. The emperor does not sit upon a
throne or chair, but is slightly raised above the floor—three
of the ordinary mats of the country, placed one above the
other, being used as a throne. To the back of this public
office is the residence or private apartments of the emperor;
and behind these are the female apartments of the empress,
the empress-mother, and other high ladies.</p>

<p>The “Shi shin deng” (Ch. “Tsz shin tien”) faces to the
south, to the large outer gate, the “Yio may mong”; within
this is another gate of a red inclosure, the gate of the sun,
“Hi no go mong.” On passing through this, the large
wooden-pillar-supported hall, with its roof with immense
eaves, is seen raised from the ground upon a lower framework
of wood. Before it stand an orange and a cherry tree.
Between these, six steps lead up to the wooden gallery or
veranda, which goes round the hall under eaves projecting
five or six feet from the supports. A low balustrade surrounds
this veranda. Under this large canopy of roof, almost
in the open air, the Emperor sits while he receives
homage. The “Shi shin deng” occupies the red inclosure,
having on the east side a small wooden building for covering
the car used in processions; to the east of that is the building
in which the “three jewels” are kept, the “Naishi dokoro.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
Within the “Shi shin deng” all extraordinary formal business
of importance is transacted. The Shiogoon here presents
himself to the Emperor. In the long hall to the west
of the “Shi shin deng,” the “Say rio deng” (“Tsing liang
tien”) or “Hiru no ma,” the mid-day room, ordinary business
is transacted. Immediately in the rear of the “Shi shin
deng” is the “Nai go bansho,” or inner hall for business.
To the east side, and overlooking the garden, is the “Tsunay
no goteng,” or hall of meeting, or drawing-room. Behind,
in the “Ko ngo sho,” the Emperor’s son and heir lives; here
also are the apartments of the elder women. “Nanga Hashi
no Tsubo nay” is the room in which levees are held, where
rank is given, and degradations or punishments are awarded.
Formerly all the offices of the different departments of government
were in the neighborhood of the palace, but outside,
at a distance of one “cho,” or 120 yards.</p>

<p>At the back of all are the female apartments. On the
east side, outside of the inclosure, is the Gakumonjo, or
imperial school.</p>

<p>To the southeast of the whole is another inclosure, the
“Ko een go sho,” the palace of the Emperor after he has
abdicated, when he is known as Kubo, covering a space of
ground nearly as large as the palace inclosure. Adjoining
this, and immediately to the south, is the residence of the
father or predecessor of the abdicated emperor. He is known
as Sento (Tsin tung). To the southwest is that of the empress
dowager, and the females of the old emperor’s court.
The Shi sin wo, or four royal families, are located in the
neighborhood, while all around are the residences, with inclosures
of ground, belonging to the “Go sekkay,” or “five
assisting” families. Among these also is found a small inclosure,
the residence of the Sho shi dai, the envoy of the
Shiogoon at the imperial court.</p>

<p>Except the greater elevation and whiteness of the roofs,
there is nothing to distinguish the palace from the adjacent
streets. That the Emperor should be thus housed probably
involves a great state principle. The houses of Daimios and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
high officers are built in a much more durable manner. The
Shiogoon’s residences at Osaka, Miako, Yedo, and other
places, are generally built more like fortifications or places
of great strength. In similar style are raised the houses,
palaces or forts of the Daimios in their respective provinces.
It cannot, therefore, be from any fear of earthquakes that
this style of a plain wood-and-paper house is adopted, but it
is probably founded on the same principle as that on which
the imperial pedigree is drawn up; viz., with the view of
giving to it the appearance of a temple, and surrounding the
Emperor with the circumstances and attributes of a god.</p>

<p>This palace in Miako appears to be the only one now used
by the Emperor. He is supposed to move from it temporarily
only upon rare occasions. When he is obliged to change his
residence, as when the palace is burned down, he occupies
apartments in some one of the many temples in the neighborhood.
Any display of splendor in building is reserved
for the Shiogoon, who has several palaces of great size and
strength, as at Miako, Osaka, Fusimi, Yedo, Kofoo, Soonpoo,
all of which are laid out on the plan of forts and built with
a view to defense from military attacks.</p>

<p>It has been stated, and often repeated, that the Emperor
of Japan sits on a throne all day without moving his hands,
or even his eyes; that he is treated as a god, and that his
subjects believe that the empire totters if he is unsteady.
These are the exaggerations of the lower classes. There
is no doubt that he is treated with the greatest reverence
and respect—that he is, as it were, an ideal abstraction, a
thing apart, necessary to the empire—that he is the Lord’s
anointed, and not to be touched, and that no subject, however
great he may be, or however firmly he may have
grasped the power of the empire in the convulsions of a
revolutionary period, may contemplate placing himself upon
that seat; and we shall find that two of the greatest men
who rose to the highest power did not dare to take such a
step, though one, and perhaps both, proposed it to himself,
and broached the idea to his followers. Though Nobunanga
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>set up a representation of himself to be worshiped, he did
not set aside the Emperor; and though Taikosama proposed
to depose the Emperor, his followers would not allow it, or at
least dissuaded him from making the attempt. Still the Emperor
is not altogether looked upon as the spiritual being he
is generally represented in modern books. Indeed, in the
first periods of the history of the country the head of the empire
was the commander, the leader of the army. Zinmu
led his army to victory; and long after him the Empress
Jinku Kogoo led her army into Corea. Her son Osin, better
known by his posthumous title of Hatchimang, was at the
head of his army. But where there is no enemy to fight
the post of commander-in-chief soon falls into abeyance.
Japan has long been in this position—of having no enemy to
watch or to attack. Such a position entails, almost of necessity,
the creation of a duality or double power. The weak
condition to which the imperial court descended, after it had
been denuded of its power, and after the command of its
armies had fallen from the hands of scions of the blood-royal
into those of other families, was followed by convulsions,
civil wars, and bloodshed, till the people returned to a state
of ignorance, and the fields to barrenness; but this seems
only a consequence of having no enemy, no near neighbor
with whom, by a process of constant watching and battling,
as in Europe, the sinews of a nation are strengthened, and
national feeling is concentrated into a unity.</p>

<p>The annals of the emperors show that, for long after the
time of Zinmu, his successors took an active part in the politics,
the wars, and the intrigues of the state. It is not a
matter of wonder that the hands which held the scepter
should have become feeble during the fierce civil wars which
raged in the sixteenth century. The country would seem
to have been driven by necessity to have two emperors—or
at least, two opposing interests; and when the hereditary
commander-in-chief had in turn become a nonentity, one
adventurer after another started up—first, Nobunanga; secondly,
Taikosama; thirdly, Iyeyas, all able men. The first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
battled with the Buddhist priesthood, the second turned his
arms against Corea, the third, the ablest of all, devised that
dual system of seemingly divided empire, by which the power
of the executive remained in the hands of the Shiogoon at
Yedo, while the source or fountain of honors remained with
the Emperor in Miako. The configuration of the islands prevents
their being cut into two empires; it remained for Iyeyas
to devise a dual system by which peace has been preserved
in a remarkable way for two hundred and fifty years.</p>

<p>As to the titles by which the Emperor is known, these are
drawn in most part from the Chinese, and denote, in language
suited to Oriental ideas, the illustrious position which
he holds. The names express the idea that he reigns by
divine right. The oldest of these titles seems to be Mikoto.
This is a Japanese word meaning “venerable,” and translated
into Chinese, “tsun.” The word Mikado is more commonly
used now, and is translated by the Chinese “Ti,” or
emperor. The word “O” or “Wo” is the Chinese “Wang,”
emperor; and the word “ten,” or heaven, is commonly
added—“Ten wo,” the heavenly ruler; or the combination
“Owo,” or “Oho-wo,” meaning the great ruler, in which
sense “Dai-wo” is also used. “Tenshi” is the “tien-tsi” of
China, the son of heaven. “O-ooji,” the great family, is
sometimes applied to the Emperor. The common people talk
of the Emperor as “Miyako sama,” in contradistinction to
“Yedo sama,” the Shiogoon, the Lord of Yedo. “Ooyaysama,”
or the superior lord, is also used. “Dairi,” made
up of two Chinese words signifying the inner court or “the
interior,” is equivalent to the words “the court” in English,
and seems to include the residences of the royal families and
higher nobility. It is, however, sometimes applied to the
Emperor himself, and sometimes to the palace as a building.
The first word, “dai” is written both “great,” <i>ta</i>, and “inner,”
<i>nai</i>. The latter seems the more common. “Gosho”
is a word sometimes applied to the palace, at others to the
Emperor and the government. The word “in,” or “een,”
is a Buddhist word, added to the posthumous name of some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
of the deceased emperors instead of “Ten wo.” In addition
to these, other names are used, as “Kwo tei,” or ruler of the
people, “Chokku,” etc.</p>

<p>From the earliest period in the history of Japan, mention
is made of three things which necessarily appertain to the
person who sits upon the throne. They seem to be looked
on as symbols of the imperial power, as palladia of the empire.
In one of the treatises upon the Emperor’s court it is
said of these mysterious emblems: “In that early time the
heaven-illuminating god arrived at Kashiwabarra, then the
capital, and placed an eight-cubit mirror and a grass-shaving
sword in the palace, on the throne of the Emperor, and these
received such homage as was rendered in the early times.
The efficacy of the god was very great, so that the Emperor,
dwelling with this god (these divine symbols), was, as it
were, equal to a god. Within the palace these things were
laid up, that the divine power might remain wherever these
things were. At that time (two high officers) regulated the
sacrificial rites and ceremonies until the tenth emperor, who,
fearing the sacredness of the divine presence, took these two
efficacious symbols, the sword and the mirror, and put them
away in another place, which was the origin of the idea of
the Emperor sitting like a god in the place of a god.”</p>

<p>In this quotation only two things are mentioned—the
sword and the mirror. A third is spoken of sometimes as a
ball of crystal, at others as a seal, “sinji.” Klaproth calls
it a ball of greenstone with two small round holes. The
three things go by the name of “Sanjioo no jinji.” During
the long and bloody wars between the emperors of the north
and south, in the sixteenth century, the former, who resided
in Miako, and finally established himself on the throne, was
not considered incontestably emperor until he obtained possession
of these three sacred symbols. Though the emperor
of the south was hard pressed, and almost a refugee in the
mountains, he kept possession of them, and finally concluded
a truce, delivering them up to his opponent, emperor <i>de
facto</i>. On one occasion the three precious jewels were stolen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
and after being kept several months were recovered or sent
back. On several occasions they have narrowly escaped
destruction by fire, and in the year 1040 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> the mirror was
broken by the heat; but the pieces were recognized and
placed together. Within the last few years (in 1851) they
were again nearly exposed to a similar chance of destruction,
but were saved by Hoongay Hashimoto, who brought them
out at the risk of his life.</p>

<p>In Japan it is usual to perform a ceremony at the time
when the boy assumes the <i>toga virilis</i> and becomes a man.
The age at which this takes place is not settled, and seems
to vary from the tenth to the fifteenth year. The eldest son
of the Emperor undergoes this operation (known as “Gembuko”;
Ch., “yuen fuh”) about the age of ten or eleven,
when he, according to the custom, receives a new name.
His hair is shaved off in the manner usual with men, and he
assumes a dress. In all families the occasion is an important
one, and in the case of the son of the Emperor, the heir-apparent,
it becomes national. At the inauguration of the
Emperor (according to Klaproth) his height is measured with
a bamboo, which is deposited in one of the great temples in
the province of Isse until his death, when it is removed to
another, and revered as a spirit. With the bamboo of the
reigning Emperor are deposited a straw-hat, a grass rain-mantle,
and a spade, emblems of agriculture, held in Japan
as an occupation second only to that of the soldier.</p>

<p>The Emperor is said to have his eyebrows shaved, and to
blacken his teeth every morning, which operation is effected
by a mixture of sulphate of iron and some astringent bark.
The state dresses of the Emperor are generally of very rich
strong silk of a bright green color. The shape, the color, the
pattern are all fixed, and not left to choice. His under garments
are of white silk, and called “mookoo”; and this is
the part of his dress which he never wears twice. Besides
being changed every morning, there are other occasions during
the day in which necessity demands a change. These
white silk dresses are the perquisites of one of the servants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
and are sold by him in Miako. The Emperor always uses
cold water for bathing. The cups which he uses for his
meals are also broken; but when it is remembered that the
Chinese and Japanese style of eating requires only one cup,
and this perhaps not a very expensive one, the total does not
amount to a large sum in the annual budget. He is said to
devote his time to business matters, with discussions upon
history, laws, and religion. In times past he has taken but
little part in the business of the country; but his share in
this is every year upon the increase, and he is courted by
those who see in what direction political power is tending.
The power of conferring titles and rank may have given him
an amount of occupation and an acquaintance with mankind
which would hardly leave him the nonentity he has generally
been described. Twelve days of the month are set apart
for conversations and discussions upon the history, laws, and
religion of Japan. Such spare time as he has is devoted to
the composition of poetry, with music and chess. The Emperor
is supposed to move out of his palace and the grounds
and gardens adjoining only twice a year—once during spring,
and once in autumn—when he goes in a covered car, inclosed
by semi-transparent screens of bamboo, drawn by large bullocks,
to visit the environs of Miako. This procession is
known as “Miyuki” or “Gokowo.”</p>

<p>On this state procession the Emperor is accompanied by
all the high officers in Miako. He does not always strictly
adhere to this rule of seclusion, however. Twenty-five years
ago Kokaku was in the practice of walking about the town
with his son, afterward Jin-ko, dressed like a common man.
The excuse for this was that his palace was being rebuilt,
after having been burned down. After the Emperor has
abdicated no restrictions are placed upon him.</p>

<p>The Emperor, like the majority of his countrymen, is a
vegetarian in his diet, and, in addition, eats only fish. At
one time such animal food as venison was considered fit for
royalty; but the story goes that the Emperor Ssu-jio heard
one evening a doe crying plaintively for her mate. On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
succeeding morning he came to the conclusion that some
venison for his breakfast was the missing lover; and, ever
since, venison has not been included among the dainties of
the royal kitchen. In his time the Emperor and all his court
began to wear the stiff-starched ample robes still used, and
the long “kio” or train, which was introduced to prevent the
feet of retreating courtiers being seen. On leaving the presence
of the Emperor, officers walk backward on their knees.</p>

<p>Some writers have alleged that the Emperor is looked
upon as a god, and that the people think that he goes in the
eleventh month to the meeting of the spirits, the “kami.”
This meeting is believed by the lower classes in Japan to take
place during the eleventh month in the province of Idzumo,
at the temple of Oyashiro, which temple is thus honored
because the first spirit dwelt there. At this meeting the
spirits arrange the sublunary and mundane business of Japan
for the subsequent eleven months. The inhabitants of Idzumo
call this month “Kami ari tski,” or the spirit month.
All the other provinces call it “Kami nashi tski,” the month
without spirits. The Emperor is supposed to be above all
the kami or spirits, inasmuch as he can confer honors upon
the dead; but he is not looked upon as above the “Tento
sama,” or Lord of heaven, showing that a lower position is
assigned to the kami (or “Shin” of the Chinese) than to the
highest deity. But no one of any ordinary education in
Japan believes that the Emperor goes to this meeting of
spirits; these ideas, like many others similar in China, are
only current among the least educated of the people. During
this month, when the spirits are so occupied, none of
those ceremonies in which their assistance must be invoked,
such as marriages, adoptions, etc., takes place; no prayers
are offered, as the spirits are supposed to be engaged. At
this meeting they arrange all the marriages which are to
take place during the ensuing year. Each individual in this
world, male and female, is supposed to have a thread of existence,
“yeng.” The spirits take the pairs of threads of
those who are to be joined in matrimony and knot them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
together. So we speak of marriages being made in heaven
while the hymeneal knot is tied on earth. From this the
month is called “Yeng moosoobi tski”—<i>i.e.</i>, Tie-the-knot
month.</p>

<p>Abdication from positions of active life is very common
among all ranks in Japan. No position seems to be more
easily renounced than that of the occupation of the throne.
In a country where the heir may have the misfortune to be
brought up in the lap of luxury, and amid sensual excitements
and indulgences of every kind, it is not surprising that
the irksomeness of his position should make the holder sigh
to be relieved from it, or that vigor of mind or body is only
to be found in those cases where, the heir-apparent having
been cut off, the successor has been adopted at a late period
of his life, having been reared without the expectation of
subsequent elevation. After the Emperor has abdicated he
is named “Tai sho ten wo”—equivalent to “His most exalted
and sacred Majesty.” At the present day, upon his taking
this step, should he devote himself to religion and become
“Fo wo,” his head is shaved, and he retires to a monastic
life, and generally occupies the temple Ninaji or Omuro in
the neighborhood of Miako.</p>

<p>The Japanese are unostentatious in their customs, and
in the treatment of their great ones after death are singularly
undemonstrative. Considering that all the rites connected
with the dead are after the Buddhist ritual, and that the
Chinese devote so much money and soil to the tombs and
monuments of their ministers and great men and women,
something of the same veneration might be expected in
Japan. But, on the contrary, the tombs are generally very
small unpretending structures, consisting of a basement,
upon which a single stone is erected of no great size. Such
is the tomb of Yoritomo, the great hero, in the neighborhood
of Kamakura; and such, we are told, are the tombs of the
emperors. They are covered over with a roofing of straw,
to keep before their countrymen and subjects the remembrance
of their primeval simplicity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>As to the succession to the throne, the laws or regulations
in Japan do not seem to be very decided. The frequent
abdication of the ruler gives the opportunity for
securing that his successor shall have all the weight and
assistance that the predecessor can give to overcome the pretensions
of rival claimants. When the death of the Emperor
has suddenly left the throne vacant, the eldest son is supposed
to be the rightful heir. But when, as frequently has
happened, his mind and body have been enfeebled by dissipation,
and he has neither wit nor vigor to seize the reins of
power, he has too often been supplanted by the ambition
of a brother, or a wife of his father. When the Emperor
leaves only a daughter, she is married to a member of the
four imperial families, and her husband in that case becomes
Emperor. In reality, the most powerful party about the
court, when any difficulty occurs, puts in and supports the
member of the imperial family most favorable to their continuing
in power.</p>

<p>The genealogy of the Emperors is considered true and
authentic as published in the Red Book of the empire; the
pedigree of the Shiogoon is looked upon as made up. The
former is to be found fully detailed from native sources in
the works of Klaproth and Kæmpfer. The “Oon jo may
rang” is the title of a small book giving the pedigrees and
crests of the Emperor’s family, and of the koongays or nobility.
Two crests or coats-of-arms are used by the Emperor—the
one, “kiku,” for outside imperial government business,
like the flower of a chrysanthemum, with sixteen
petals; the other, the “kiri,” is used for the palace matters
personal to the Emperor and his family. No notice
seems to be taken of the common assumption of the imperial
crest, but no one dares to use the crest of the Shiogoon
except by permission.</p>

<p>The following sayings give some idea of the reverence
with which the Emperor is spoken of: “Mikado ni ooji
nashi,” is a saying to express that the Emperor is of no
family. “Tenshi foo bo nashi”—“The Emperor has neither<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
father nor mother.” “In heaven there is one sun, on earth
there is one Emperor,” is a Confucian saying in accordance
with the ideas of the country. “O wo wa jiu zenn, kami
wa ku zenn”—“The power of the Emperor is as ten, that of
the gods as nine”; implying that more reverence is due to
the Emperor than to the lesser spirits, and that he has more
power. “The Emperor all men respect, the Shiogoon all
men fear.” “Heaven is his father, earth is his mother, his
friends are the sun and moon.” Such ideas are taken from
the Chinese classics.</p>

<p>The Emperor marries one wife, who is the Empress. He
is allowed by the laws of the country to take twelve concubines,
who are generally the daughters of the poorer nobility.
The throne can be, and has frequently been, occupied
by a female. The Emperor is supposed to receive, as an
allowance from the Shiogoon, 100,000 kobangs, equal to
$350,000 per annum. This he receives from the Yedo government,
but he probably has a large revenue from land in
the “Go ki nai” or “Go ka koku,” or five provinces. He
is said to complain of the duties from foreign trade not being
paid into his treasury, inasmuch as when the trade was conducted
formerly by the Portuguese at Sakkye, the Emperor
received the duties; but as Yokohama is out of the Gokinai,
the Shiogoon prefers that the duties should flow to Yedo.
These five provinces are frequently spoken of by the writers
of the sixteenth century as the Tensee—heavenly or sacred
soil. They are Yamashiro, Yamato, Setsu, Kaawdsio, and
Idzumi. The whole empire is spoken of, as in China, as all
under heaven—“Tenka.”</p>

<p>Two officers in the Emperor’s palace are appointed from
Yedo—two Hattamoto, or inferior barons—to superintend
the disbursement of money, and to keep accounts of the
money paid by the Shiogoon’s government. These men
have fifty soldiers under them. Under them are nine “Toritsungi,”
generally men of some rank and position.</p>

<p>The Emperor’s own private establishment consists of the
following officers:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>1. Makanye Kashira, generally a Hattamoto, who keeps
the accounts of the imperial table and pays the money.</p>

<p>2. Kye mon tskye, called “Kimsakye,” two Hattamoto,
who go to buy the provisions for the palace.</p>

<p>3. Go zembang, six men, whose business is to examine
the Emperor’s food.</p>

<p>4. Shuri siki, five men, to look after the buildings; generally
Miako men of old families.</p>

<p>5. Makanye kata, six men, whose duty is to say what,
and how much, is to be purchased for the palace.</p>

<p>6. Gim miakoo and Itamoto—of the former three, of the
latter seventeen—head cooks and ordinary cooks.</p>

<p>7. Kangay bang, keepers of the keys, seven men.</p>

<p>8. Sosha bang, messengers.</p>

<p>9. Tskye bang or Kashira, three men, lower messengers.</p>

<p>These are all given in the official list as the ordinary
household in daily attendance on the emperor.</p>

<p>After his death an honorific title is given to the deceased
Emperor, by which he is subsequently known in history.</p>

<h3>THE SHI SINWO, OR FOUR IMPERIAL FAMILIES</h3>

<p>The “Shi sinwo” (“sz tsan wang”) are “four imperial
relatives,” or royal families of Japan. This name denotes
four families of imperial descent set apart, with allotted residences
and revenues, as supporters to the imperial family.
The families are cadets of the royal line descended from
junior branches. From among the members of these four
families, in case of failure of male heirs of the body, an heir
to the throne, or a husband to the Princess Imperial, is to
be sought.</p>

<p>In Japan all ranks are under laws more or less strict, and
from such the imperial family does not escape. The succession
to the throne, at all times an object in Eastern countries
for daring ambition to aim at, and a fruitful source of revolution
and misery to the people, is regulated and guarded
in Japan on a basis wide enough to secure a succession, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
preserved by such safeguards as to put it out of the power
of collaterals to hope for success from intriguing ambition.
One of these safeguards is supposed to be in the Emperor’s
being allowed to take twelve concubines over and above his
lawful wife, the Empress. These are generally daughters of
men of high rank about the court, and the son of any one
of them, if there is no son by the Empress, may succeed. If
there be a daughter, she marries one of the members of these
four families, and he becomes Emperor. Jinko, the father
of the late Emperor, succeeded in this way. His father,
Kokaku, was a member of the royal Kunnin family, and
married the only daughter of the Emperor, and so became
Emperor. He had a concubine, the daughter of Koongay
Kwadjooji. The wife and the concubine had each one son.
Satchay no mia was the son of the wife, and heir-apparent
to the throne. But the concubine was a fierce, jealous
woman, and determined that her son should succeed, and
she poisoned Satchay. It was the duty of the Shiogoon’s
envoy, Sakkye, to inquire into the reports that were circulating;
and having done so, he discovered the truth, and
put the concubine into confinement. But, though the Emperor
was much distressed, he loved her too well and insisted
on her being released. The government at Yedo heard of
what had happened, and required the envoy to give his reasons
for releasing her, when she had committed so heinous
a crime. He committed suicide. Her son, Jinko, it is said,
always paid the Empress the greatest respect, and would
never see his own mother afterward.</p>

<p>But even with this wide matrimonial basis allowed to
the Emperor, there may be a failure of heirs direct. These
four families are therefore established as a further safeguard
to the succession.</p>

<p>They take their names from collateral branches of the
imperial house, being originally the families of younger sons
of previous Emperors. At present there are only two families
of Sinwo, two having become extinct by failure of heirs.
They are, however, only dormant, as it is a part of the policy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
of the state that these families should be in existence, and it
is in the power of the Emperor to put one of his sons into, as
it were, the extinct family—that is, to call him by the name
and give him the revenues belonging to the house, which
revenues have been accruing until the family is re-established.</p>

<p>The four families are called collectively Shi (four) sin (relations)
wo (imperial). The sons of these families are called
Sinwo O’nkatta, or O’nkatta sama [O’nkatta is used as an
address of respect to ladies, and also to Sinwo and high officers
in personal attendance on the Emperor], and from these
sons a successor to the Emperor may be taken.</p>

<p>The names of the four “families” are—1, Fusimi; 2,
Arisungawa; 3, Katsura; 4, Kunnin. Of these the last two
are the dormant houses. The revenues of these two houses
are managed by factors or agents, and the fourth is said to
be very wealthy.</p>

<p>The heads of the two existing families are:</p>

<p>1. Fusimi no mia, who has a nominal revenue of 1,016
koku<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of rice; but he has probably twenty or thirty thousand
koku. The present man is a Koboong of Jinko, the late
Emperor.</p>

<p>This “boong” is a voluntary union between two persons,
and is quite different from adoption. It is more of the character
of a Masonic connection. In the relation of a child he
is called Koboong; of a father, Oyaboong; of brothers or
sisters, Kiodaiboong: and this connection is a very common
tie between two individuals in Japan, as well as in China,
to help and assist each other. It runs through all ranks and
both sexes. It is a connection which may be as easily severed
as it is made, but it is often strictly adhered to. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
generally made by drinking formally out of the same cup,
each taking half of the liquor. It may be severed by cutting
off the queue, or simply by formally intimating that it
is at an end.</p>

<p>2. Arisungawa Nakatskasa no kio, or head of the Central
Board. His nominal income is 1,000 koku, but his real
revenue is much larger.</p>

<p>3. Katsura; the revenue is 3,006 koku.</p>

<p>4. Kunnin; the revenue is nominally 1,006 koku.</p>

<p>In these families there is generally a sufficient number
from among whom to select a successor in case of the death,
or what seems more common in Japan, the abdication and
retirement, of the Emperor. But, at the same time, the
arrangement has its disadvantages. It places a number of
men and women of all ages in a very high position, with
apparently no occupation for their leisure time. These men
might become troublesome in the state by carrying on intrigues
for their own advancement and for the gratification
of their ambition. Within the last few years much disquietude
has been caused by one of the Sinwo engaging in
intrigues to upset the reigning Emperor. A means has been
arrived at for at once giving these persons income, business,
position, and at the same time getting them out of the way.</p>

<p>The Buddhist priesthood was at one time a very powerful
element in the country. The number of priests was very
great, and the revenues of the monasteries were enormous.
By their wealth, and from among their vassals, they were
able to keep up a respectable army; and not by their vassals
alone—the priests themselves filled the ranks. The different
sects built magnificent temples, and these were endowed with
ample lands. Immediately before the period of the advent
of the Christians in the sixteenth century, the power of the
priesthood seems to have reached its highest point. Nobunanga,
who at one time was inclined to favor the foreign
priests, had always a great jealousy of, and bore a great ill-will
to, the Buddhist priesthood. He destroyed their temples,
killed their priests, and confiscated their revenues, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
thus gave a blow to their power from which they have never
recovered, and under which they are withering more and
more every day.</p>

<p>In Japan, a man while a priest, after having shaved his
head and taken the vows, is supposed to be out of the world,
and it is then much easier to keep a certain amount of surveillance
over him, and to see that he is attending to his
duties, and is not engaged in political intrigues.</p>

<p>Of the larger Buddhist temples of different sects, fourteen
are retained as having the largest revenues; and whenever
a male member of the royal family is unprovided for he is
put in as head abbot or bishop of one of these temples.
They are generally appointed while children, and brought
up to the position; and as the revenues of the office have
thus time to accumulate, the reverend holder has sufficient
for his wants and those of a respectable retinue. They are
then called Sinwo Monzekke (Muntsih).</p>

<p>1. The first is Rinoji Monzekke, or abbot of Rinoji temple.
The temple over which he is abbot is To yay zan, in
Yedo. The first high-priest put into this was Koboong of
Iyeyas, then Shiogoon. The revenue amounts to 13,000
koku of rice. The holder is of the Arisungawa family, and
is of the first rank and second degree. He is known as
“Kwan rayee no mia” (from the nengo, or date, of his appointment),
and Yedo no mia or Ooyay no mia. In 1860
the incumbent was very old, and a boy, Gofutay, of the
Fusimi family, was appointed assistant and successor.</p>

<p>2. The second is Ninaji no mia, otherwise called Omuro.
The income is 1,502 koku. The incumbent is of the Fusimi
family. He is head of the Singong sect, and was appointed
to the office in 1843, when four years of age. To this temple
the Emperor generally retires should he become a priest after
abdication.</p>

<p>3. Dai Kakuji, otherwise called Sanga, is vacant.</p>

<p>4. Mio ho in, at Hiyayzan, a large temple near Miako.
The Monzekke is of the Kunnin family. He is head of the
Tendai sect of Buddhists, and is known as Tendai zass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>5. Sho ngo in no Monzekke is head of the Yamabooshi
religion. He is of the Fusimi family, with an income of
1,430 koku. His temple is at Omine Honzan.</p>

<p>6. Sho ko in; vacant, but the revenues are held by No. 5.</p>

<p>7. Say ray in Monzekke: is known as Awata Mia. He
is of the Fusimi family. The income is 1,330 koku.</p>

<p>8. Chi wong in Monzekke, of the Arisungawa family.
The temple is in Miako, and he is the head of the Jodoshiu
sect of Buddhists.</p>

<p>9. Kwajooji is vacant.</p>

<p>10. Itchi jo in Monzekke. The temple is in Narra, and
is very old. Held by one of the house of Fusimi.</p>

<p>11. Kaji ee Monzekke, of the Tendai sect. Of the family
of Fusimi, with an income of 1,600 koku.</p>

<p>12. Manjo in Monzekke is vacant.</p>

<p>13. Bissa mondo Monzekke is also vacant.</p>

<p>14. Emmang in Monzekke, commonly called Medora, in
the province of Owomi, is also vacant.</p>

<p>All these bishoprics, as they may be called, are held, or
may be held, by Sinwo or sons of Sinwo.</p>

<p>But as it is in many countries, both European and Eastern,
as necessary and as difficult to dispose of the females
of high families as the males, they also are in many cases
provided for.</p>

<p>There are twenty-four temples or nunneries which are, or
may be, under the superintendence of daughters or relatives
of the four royal families.</p>

<p>1. Daijoji, in Miako; of this temple a daughter of the
Emperor was formerly abbess.</p>

<p>2. Hokio ji.</p>

<p>3. Dan kay in.</p>

<p>4. Ko shio in.</p>

<p>5. Ray gan ji, held by one of the Fusimi family, who
has the title of Nio-wo, or Queen of Nuns.</p>

<p>6. Yenshoji, in Narra, the ecclesiastical metropolis of
Japan.</p>

<p>7. Rin kinji.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>8. Chiu goji and sixteen others of lower class. Many of
them are, however, unoccupied; partly, perhaps, from want
of ladies of the royal family to fill them, and partly from
failure of zeal for the Buddhist religion all over the country.</p>

<p>The laws with reference to the perpetuity of the vows of
these priests and priestesses do not seem to be very strict, as
we find that, when opportunity offers, the garb is thrown
off, the hair is allowed to grow, and he or she mixes again
in the world in whatever capacity their worldliness, their
ambition, or their sense, has prompted them to desire.</p>

<p>It has been stated that the Emperor, as the fountain of
honor, reserves to himself the sole right of conferring titles
and rank. This reservation throws great political power into
his hands, the acquisition of title and rank being, with rare
exceptions, an object of the highest ambition to a Japanese.
The amount of business connected with this power is great,
and may be said to have been for many years the sole occupation
for the Miako court. A special office and officers
are set apart within the palace inclosure for carrying on
the correspondence and settling disputes connected with the
department.</p>

<h3>RANKS OF MEN IN JAPAN</h3>

<p>Every individual in Japan, whether noble, priest or peasant,
is supposed to know the rank in which he stands relatively
to those about him. The marks of respect to superiors—which
in degree appear excessive to Western nations—are
graduated from a trifling acknowledgment to the most
absolute prostration. When two men or women meet, the
first point to be ascertained seems to be, which of the two is
to make the acknowledgment of the social position of the
other. This state of things is supported by law as well as
custom, and more particularly by the permission given to a
two-sworded man, in case of his feeling himself insulted, to
take the law into his own hands. What would be irksome
to us seems to become easy and a matter of course in Japan;
and though, no doubt, the assumption of position is often the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
source of brawls and fights, the system works more smoothly
than might have been expected.</p>

<p>The custom of wearing two swords was introduced in the
sixteenth century. The old Miako nobility do not adopt the
custom—civilian Koongays wearing no sword, and military
only one as of old. All Japan is divided into two classes:
those who have a right to wear two swords, the “Nihon
sashi shto” or “two-sworded man,” called also “Yashiki
shto” or castle retainers; and those who have no such right,
the “Matchi shto” or street man (otherwise called Chonin).
The latter class comprises merchants, artisans, workmen,
etc., who work at some trade, but possess no ground; and
also Hiaksho, farmers who do not trade, but farm or rent
ground. In some cases individuals of these classes can wear
two swords. The “swordless man” in Yedo pays rent for
his ground, house and shop. The “two-sworded man” pays
no rent and no taxes, because he is not allowed to trade. In
Yedo, parts of the town are known as “Matchi tsuchee,”
street ground, and other parts as “Yashiki tsuchee,” castle
ground. Persons living on the former can open shops and
trade; in the latter this is not allowed. This last two-sworded
class is known as “Samurai” (Ch. Sz), which
may be translated “an officer and a gentleman,” and is
an important distinction conferring valuable rights and
privileges at the expense of the rest of the community.</p>

<p>This division of the people into two classes is a measure
issuing from the executive at Yedo, the Shiogoon’s government,
rather than from Miako. The Samurai class may
be said to include the Koongays, the Daimios, the “Jiki
sang,” who are the officers and sub-officers in the service of
the Shiogoon; the Byshing—<i>i.e.</i>, officers in the service of
Daimios; and such Chonin as are doing duty as officers in
some large town, such as Osaka or Miako, and are always
spoken of in connection with the city—as Osaka chonin, for
instance. The term “Samurai” is applied more particularly
to all below the fifth rank, military or civilians who are not
merchants or artisans. There are others who have the right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
to wear two swords, such as Goshi, large farmers or landed
proprietors whose ancestors were Daimios. These are strongest
in the provinces of Kahi, Etsjiu and Dewa, some being
very wealthy—as Homma in Dewa, and Hanagura in Etsjiu.
The Samurai who have the right to wear two swords assume
the right of giving two swords to their attendants; and this
right, once assumed, is not readily relinquished, seeing that
a two-sworded man has the privilege of traveling at a much
cheaper rate than other members of society, pays no tolls or
taxes, and not infrequently pays nothing for food and lodging,
their power being so great that they are feared, if not
in actual attendance upon some superior. These men are
frequently dismissed by, or voluntarily leave the service of,
their Daimio or master; but as those who are so dismissed are
often brawlers, they retain their swords, and gain a living
by their becoming a terror to quiet people. They are said
to be “floating,” without any attachment, like straws on a
stream, and are thence called “Ronin” or “floating-man.”
These men are most imperious and domineering toward
others not having the same privileges as themselves, and
this power compels wealthy traders and others to enroll
themselves in the retinue of some Daimio, or take some
other roundabout mode to prevent themselves being insulted.
This is not the character of every Ronin, many
of whom are respectable members of society, holding their
privileges in abeyance until called upon to give feudal service
by some superior.</p>

<p>The people of Japan are divided generally into the following
classes:</p>

<p>1. Koongays, or Miako nobility.</p>

<p>2. Daimios, or Yedo nobility.</p>

<p>3. Hattamoto—Lower Daimio class.</p>

<p>4. Hiaksho—Farmers and landed proprietors without
rank or title.</p>

<p>5. Shokonin—Artisans, carpenters, etc.</p>

<p>6. Akindo—Merchants.</p>

<p>7. Kweiamono—Actors, beggars, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>8. Yayta—Tanners, shoemakers, leather workers, skinners.</p>

<p>Beneath these are prostitutes, and all connected with
them, who are considered beasts, or on a level with them.</p>

<p>In opposition to the name of “Koongay” (Kung kia),
“exalted house,” the nobility of Miako, the Daimios and
officers of the Shiogoon’s court, are called “Jee ngay” (Ti
hia), meaning persons low, on a level with the ground, the
latter not being recognized by the Emperor as feudal lords
further than as servants of his servant, “Tokungawa”—<i>i.e.</i>
the Shiogoon.</p>

<p>The Japanese titles and classification of officers have been
taken generally from China. As in China, all the officers
honored with titles by the Emperor, or performing duties
about the court, are divided into classes or ranks. In China
the Mandarins are divided into nine classes. Each of these
classes is again subdivided into a first and secondary division.
The same division and subdivision are found in
Japan, with this difference, that there are six classes, each
subdivided into four ranks. The word used for rank is I,
otherwise called Kurai. This is the Chinese word Wai.
The six ranks in order are, Itchi-i, Ni-i, Sanm-i, Shi-i, Go-i
and Roko-i. Each of these is divided according to the
Chinese classification into two, the “shio” (or “jio”) and
the “jiu,” corresponding to the “ching” and the “tsung.”
These are subdivided again into two—upper and lower—“jio”
and “gay,” the Chinese “shang” and “hia.” The
full description of men of the first and second ranks would
be respectively “Jo itchi-i no jio” and “Jo itchi-i no gay”—the
“no” meaning “of.” The minor divisions “jio” and
“gay” are not much used in the higher ranks until the
highest is reached, an honor now reserved only for the
dead. Indeed, all below Shi-i, or the fourth grade, are
commonly known now by a general name, “Sho dai boo”
(“Chu ta fu”). The higher classes wear at court distinguishing
dresses and colors, or devices upon black dresses,
and they are entitled in virtue of their rank to have a spear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
carried before them when moving about officially. Officers
are presented at court, both at Miako and Yedo, according
to their rank, not according to the importance of their office.
Few of the Daimios are higher than the first subdivision of
the fourth rank. The Shiogoon himself is elevated from one
rank to another by the favor of the Emperor, at times not
rising higher than the first subdivision of the second class.
To attain such rank at the imperial court is the great object
of ambition in Japan, and next in importance is the acquisition
of a title conferred by the Emperor. But as some titles,
though not recognized at court, are used by the Daimios as
holding territory under the Shiogoon, there is a distinction
observed between the two. The holders of titles conferred
by the Emperor are known as “Kio kwang” (King kwan) or
imperial officers, while the Daimios are known from their
territorial appellations as “Kooni kami” (Kwoh shau), or
keepers of the provinces. An imperial title in the address
is always placed before the territorial title.</p>

<h3>THE KOONGAY</h3>

<p>After the Emperor and royal families, the first in rank in
the state are the Koongays. Until further light be thrown
upon Japanese history, the remote origin of this class will
be somewhat obscure, some tracing their pedigree back upward
of 1,500 years. Many of the Koongays are descendants
of younger sons and cadets of the imperial family
branching off at former periods, while the surnames of some
of the other families are as old as historic records. In all
probability their forefathers came over to Japan at the time
of its invasion and conquest by Zinmu, and being the assistants,
brothers in arms, and mainstays of his throne and
power, the soil about the center of the empire was divided
among them, and they thenceforward became the nobility of
the court of the Emperor. So long as the empire was under
one emperor who ruled vigorously, this aristocracy seems to
have existed in the central provinces as feudal lords, much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
in the same way as the Daimios of the present day. But
when the vigor of rule relaxed, and power fell into the hands
of a commander-in-chief, or mayor of the palace, with uncertainty
in the rulers, there followed division in the aristocracy.
Previous to the beginning of the fifteenth century,
the western part of the empire was all that was known to
any who could throw light upon its position by writing.
The large tract of country to the north and northeast of
Yedo, called the obscure or unpenetrated way, was comparatively
unknown and uninhabited, and was divided into
four or five large territories, under princes who seldom
heard of, and more rarely visited, the court at Miako. The
dissensions and struggles for power between the two powerful
families of Heji and Genji gave rise to a nearly continual
state of civil war for upward of 200 years. During the Onin
war families were destroyed, territories were lost, might was
everywhere right, and though several of the oldest and
noblest families among the Koongays retained their honors
and titles and places about the court, they lost their property,
and many have ever since remained at the lowest ebb
of poverty.</p>

<p>Those few noble families which had previously to this
period of civil war divided among themselves the places and
titles of the court, were denuded of their splendor; but their
representatives continued to struggle on with poverty, proud
in the possession of an ancient lineage, and of their names
being enrolled as nobles in the Great Book of the empire.
These are the Koongays of the present day. They are not
all in this state of poverty, many of them being well off, and
some very wealthy; but others are very poor, and eke out
the scanty subsistence given them by the Emperor by painting,
basket-making, and other manual employments, affording,
in their persons, their poverty, and their pretensions,
ample scope for the pen of the native caricaturist. The
names, history, and pedigree of the Koongays are enrolled
in the Great Book of the empire, the equivalent to the Heralds’
Office or Patent Office of England. A book, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
“Koongay no Kayzu,” or Pedigree of the Koongays, is
printed in Japan, giving all these particulars, and is generally
by the natives considered authentic. The names of
Daimios (as such) are not so enrolled; they have no patents
of nobility from the Emperor, and the “Hang campu,” giving
the pedigree and history of the families of Daimios, is
regarded as anything but authentic, and is looked upon
as in many cases made up by individuals to conceal the
origin of the family.</p>

<p>The Koongay class includes all the illustrious families of
Japan. In common estimation the Daimios are far below
this class; and even the Shiogoon, though he is feared as the
head of the executive, is looked upon as comparatively a
parvenu.</p>

<p>The class is divided into two, an older or higher, the
“Koongio,” and a lower, or more recently created, “Ten jio
bito” (Tien shang jin). “Koongio” (Kung hiang) is a name
which includes all the officers of the first, second and third
ranks. All of the fourth rank and below are called “So
shing,” in which are included “Ten jio bito,” “Sho diabu,”
and “Samurai.” The appellation “Mayka” (ming kia)
seems to denote that the bearer is a civilian. All the higher
offices in the state are filled by Koongays, but only five
families are eligible to fill the highest. These five families
are known as the “Go sek kay” (Wu ship kia), or “Shippay
kay,” or “Sessio no eeyay,” helper of emperor—lit., to take
the handle—“the five assisting families.” They are: 1,
Konoyay; 2, Koojio; 3, Nijio; 4, Itchijio; 5, Takatskasa.
If the highest offices under the Emperor (as those of “Dai
jio dai jin,” “Kwanbakku,” or “Sessio”) be vacant, no
one who is not of one of these five families is eligible to
fill such office.</p>

<p>In regard to rank at court, the Koongays generally stand
in the lower class of the first, or in the second or third rank.
They are known at Miako by their dress. For a long time
past they have had little power, and were of little importance;
but since the commencement of foreign relations the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
political tide has rather flowed toward Miako, and from
Yedo, and they have increased in political power as well as
in wealth, as the Daimios and office-seekers of Yedo endeavor
to obtain the objects of their ambition through the influence
of their poorer brethren in Miako. The poverty of most of
the class prevents their entering upon an enervating life
of dissipation, which too often saps the vigor of the constitution
of the Daimios, and they are able to take a part in the
discussion of political subjects. Many of them fill the more
or less nominal offices of government in one of the eight
great boards of the empire; and this amount of occupation,
together with writing imaginative pieces, keeps their minds
in a sufficient state of activity.</p>

<p>In addition to the distinctions of rank in Japan, there is
also the distinction into families or clans, great importance
being attached to a family name. The feuds between rival
families have in past times rent the empire to pieces. The
Emperor is said to have no name; but some of the cadets,
offshoots from the imperial line, have founded lines of their
own, taking root and flourishing as distinct families. In this
way have been derived the lines known as the “Say wa
Genji,” the “Ooda Genji,” and the “Murakami Genji.”
These are descendants of younger sons of emperors of these
names. But among all the families of Japan, the first place
is held by that of Fusiwara, in length of pedigree, in the
honors held in past ages, and in the present position of the
family. During every period in the annals of the empire,
members of this family have filled the highest offices, civil
and military, of the state. But it has, perhaps, shone more
in civil employment than in military. The “five families”
of the Sekkay mentioned above belong to the clan Fusiwara.
Other families have risen at different times to the highest
pinnacle attainable by subjects, but after a time they have
gradually fallen back into comparative obscurity. Ninety-five
of the Koongays call themselves of the clan Fusiwara.
In very remote periods the family of Nakatomi seems to
have held the highest rank, absorbing by its members, at one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
time, all the offices of religion. Only one Koongay family,
Fusinami, now represents this old clan. In point of antiquity,
if not of luster of name, the Sungawara family, commonly
called Kwang kay, ranks second only to Fusiwara.
The members of this family are rarely found in military employment,
generally filling the offices of teachers or lecturers
on history or religion.</p>

<p>The “Gen kay,” otherwise called “Minnamoto,” are more
illustrious as military men. Seventeen families of the Koongays
belong to this clan. All the Minnamoto Koongays are
descended from younger sons of former emperors. One of
these, the “Say wa” Minnamoto, assert that their line is the
same as that of the present imperial dynasty of China, who
are descendants of the Emperor Say wa, or “Tsing wa,”
whence the “Tsing” or “Ta Tsing” family, which emigrated
from the north of Japan several centuries ago.</p>

<p>The Taira, or He kay, the great opponent of the Gen kay
(otherwise known as Heji and Genji) during many years of
civil war, includes five families.</p>

<p>Nishika koji, of the Tanba clan, is said to represent one
of the emperors of China of the Eastern Han dynasty, who
was driven from China and took refuge in Japan.</p>

<p>A new creation of Koongays is very rare. About 1830,
Kitta koji (of the clan Oway), whose family for three generations
had filled the office of Kurodo, was elevated to the
rank.</p>

<p>The names of Koongays are, in many cases, derived from
the street or place where they originally lived, as Itchi jio,
No. 1 Street.</p>

<p>There are in all 137 Koongays.</p>

<p>There is assigned to each Koongay an annual revenue
calculated in koku of rice. This, in most cases, implies so
much ground held of the Emperor. The total sum divided
among these noble families does not amount to that allowed
to a third-rate Daimio. But though several of these nobles
are miserably poor, and have probably little to live upon
besides the rice which is given them by the Emperor, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
are some among them who have other sources of wealth.
In old times the Koongays possessed large landed property;
but in the wars of the He kay and Gen kay, Kiomori, the
leader of the former, despoiled them, and the divided portions
of these lands were seized by whoever had the power.
Some still retain extensive landed property, but the majority
have fixed salaries, which they receive at the Emperor’s
hands. Residing near the court, and often connected with
the Emperor and high officers by marriage, the poorest may
possess some influence, and this frequently contributes to
swell their incomes. This influence is courted by the Daimios
at a distance, who, aspiring to rank or titles, purchase the
assistance and influence of the Koongays, such as it may be,
by solid presents. The higher class, who really have much
power, in this way become very rich. The little land which
belongs to them may, by taxes, duties, or customs, produce
much more than the exact number of koku of the original
calculation. Thus the seaport town of Itami stands on the
ground of Konoyay dono, and he levies a tax upon the exports
and imports; and, in addition to the customs, he receives
the duties upon all the saki or spirit distilled between
the towns of Hiogo and Osaka, and this is the great distilling
district for the whole country. Having acquired money, he
lends it out at Oriental rates of interest to the Daimios, who
are too often in need of ready money, so that he is a very
wealthy man. The Koongays have not the large expenses
which drain the purses of the Daimios; having comparatively
few retainers, they are not obliged to make the ostentatious
display which brings the Daimios to poverty; nor
have they the same number of establishments to keep up
at different places. All this contributes to make the upper
class of Koongays, already powerful by rank, position and
influence, substantial in their independence. The poorer
class eke out their existence in a variety of ways, honorable
enough, but not contributing much in the way of worldly
wealth. Assukayee teaches playing at “mari,” a sort of
football, which is a fashionable game at court, and which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
probably derived from the Chinese shuttlecock, varied according
to the difference in the style of boots and shoes.
In playing at this game in Miako, the court turns out in
gorgeous dresses. Jimio-in and others teach writing. Sono
dono teaches the science of dwarfing trees and the art of
arranging flowers in flower-holders. At both of these the
Japanese excel. In the former they display a wonderful
power over nature, and in the latter a highly cultivated
taste. A fir-tree has been seen in perfect vigor, bearing
a cone, and eight years old, and only an inch in height.
Rayzay teaches poetry and composition. Sijio dono teaches
the art of dressing dinners and cookery, which is considered
in Japan the occupation of a gentleman. When an artist
has prepared a dinner, and laid it out, it is common for the
public to go to see it as a work of art. Yamashima and
Takakura superintend and teach the art of dressing and
of etiquette. Tsutchi Mikado teaches and explains what
is known in China as the “Ta kih,” the ultimate cause of
things, the immaterial principle of the Chinese philosophers,
as contained in and exemplified by a series of diagrams; and,
as an astrologer, divines into futurity. Others paint, and
sell their works of art, or teach painting. The poorer individuals
who receive rice also get the Emperor’s cast-off outer
garments. Their daughters are in the habit of going to the
families of the Daimios as governesses (and are commonly
known by the name of “jorosama”), to teach the young
ladies and gentlemen the customs and language of the court.
Of these ladies there are generally one or more at the residence
of the Shiogoon in Yedo. They sometimes act in
the capacity of spies as well as of governesses; and, having
much influence, they are sometimes feared as <i>censores
morum</i>.</p>

<p>Under the five Go sekkay nearly all the Koongays are
classed into five divisions; and in his relation to his head,
each Koongay is known as “Monrio” or “Sorio”—one division
under each of the five.</p>

<p>If any of those in a position of Monrio have any business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
with the court, such must be dispatched through his head,
who then communicates with the Emperor.</p>

<p>It has been shown that the Sin wo and sons of the imperial
families are provided for by absorption into the higher
offices of the priesthood, and to fill the seats in, and receive
the revenues of, the richer abbeys and monasteries. In a
similar way the sons of the Go sekkay and higher Koongays
(known as Kindatchi) are provided for. There are six richly-endowed
temples whose revenues are respectively enjoyed by
a member of one of these families. These men are known
by the name of “Sekkay Monzekke.”</p>

<p>If a Daimio happens to meet the norimono or sedan-chair
of a Koongay upon the highroad, he must wait with all his
retinue till the latter shall have passed. Koongays usually
blacken their teeth and shave the eyebrows, and do not follow
the usual custom in shaving the head. Civilians do not
carry a sword; military carry one called “tatchi.” In ordinary
times a Koongay is not likely to be put to death, however
great may be his crimes; but he may be ordered to
shave his head and enter a monastery, or may be confined
to a room in his own house.</p>

<p>It is not easy to ascertain what was the exact position of
the Koongays in the times before the great civil wars of the
thirteenth and following centuries. The empire seems to
have been divided at that time very much as it is now, into
one large central court at the metropolis, with a number of
smaller courts in the provinces, each ruled by its lord, king,
Daimio, or dynasta, as they have been called. The court of
the Emperor always remained at Miako. There he was surrounded
by the members of the old families, among whom
he distributed honors. There was to be seen a supposed prefect
form of government, the history of which is written in
the “Annals.” Probably in each of the lesser courts—such,
for instance, as that of Satsuma, Mowori, and other wealthy
lords—the same form of government was carried on in a
miniature scale; and, so far as can be gathered from history
and native historical maps, the extensive territories belonging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
to these lords were always under the entire rule each of
its own master, and acknowledging no right in the central
court (so long as that master did not in any way come into
collision with the general good of the empire) to interfere
in any way with what passed within these territories. The
imperial court, in its executive form, was confined to the
provinces around Miako—the Gokinai. The annals of the
Emperors are devoted in the main to the occurrences which
took place within these provinces, detailing the names and
families, the titles, ranks, and history of the men who in
that court were looked upon as great and eminent. Of
these, the more prominent were brought forward and advanced
by the Emperor in hereditary rank and title above
their fellows—these were the Koongays; while the territorial
lords were only known by their family names, or the name
of the provinces over which they ruled, and were only expected
to come once a year to Miako, in order to pay their
respects to the Emperor. It is not to be expected but that
differences would arise among these territorial lords, some
more or less powerful; ambition and lust of wealth or power
would soon find a cause for a quarrel, and this would light
up a civil war. In such cases, the Emperor and the officers
of the imperial court were looked to as the arbiters or umpires,
and acquired and retained so firm a position in the
machinery of the State and in the minds of the people as to
withstand all the shocks which have at different times so
frequently and rudely put one down and set up another of
these provincial powers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>THE EIGHT BOARDS OF GOVERNMENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> given above a sketch of the ranks eligible in old
times to fill the offices of government, a step will be gained
by obtaining some insight into the means by which that
government was carried on. The arrangements are of very
ancient date, and seem to have been more or less in actual
use until the separation of the empire into two at the end of
the sixteenth century. At that time the executive department
of the empire was entirely removed to Yedo, but the
shadow or the skeleton of the defunct body was allowed to
remain in Miako. The offices which had of old conferred
power, and demanded exertion in fulfilling the duties, were
now only empty names—honorific appellations; the power
of conferring these nominal offices being all that remained
to the Emperor of his former greatness. Still the retention
of the power has not been without its use. Though the
actual power has been in the hands of the Shiogoon, the
hopes of the people and of the Emperor have ever turned
toward its ultimate re-establishment at Miako, in a machinery
all ready at any moment to take up the duties of government.</p>

<p>At the period when the government of Japan was settled,
many of the institutions of China seem to have been copied
or transferred by the founders of the empire. This must
have occurred at a very early period in its history. While
the original model has been followed, modifications have
from time to time been introduced to meet the varying
exigencies of the country. But perhaps nothing points more
strongly to a Chinese origin for the ruling ranks of Japan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
than the early adoption of this form of government. As in
China six boards are found at Pekin, so in Japan eight boards
are found at Miako. The names of these boards or departments,
the titles of the officials, the ranks of the subordinate
officers, are all found under Chinese names.</p>

<p>Klaproth has given in his “Annals of the Emperors” a
sketch of these eight boards, with the offices under each. It
is probably taken from the “Shoku gen sho,” a little work
written in the year 1340 by Kitta Batake Chikafusa, and
in use at the present day as a concise account of the government
of Japan.</p>

<p>The study of such a subject is rather dry and uninteresting,
but it is necessary for any one who wishes to make himself
acquainted with Japanese history, either of the past or
of the present day, to read and understand this book. What
here follows is only a rough sketch with a little further filling
in. In what may be called the preface to the “Shoku gen
sho”—a slight historical introduction—the author says: “We
gather from old records, that in the time of Sui ko (the first
Empress), in the twelfth year of her reign, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 605, Sho
toku, being prime minister, settled twelve grades of officers.
Afterward, the Emperor Kwo toku, in the fifth year of his
reign (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 650), divided the country into eight provinces (or
divided the government into eight departments), and definitely
fixed the offices. Subsequently, in the first year of the
Emperor Mun moo (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 697), Fusiwara no tan kaiko Kamatariko
(canonized as Kassunga dia mio jin) was appointed
great minister, and by him laws were made and the officers
and nobles were appointed. At one time the numbers were
greatly diminished, and again they were increased, and fresh
officers, ‘uncommissioned,’ got employment. But the ministers,
the ‘Nai dai jin’ and the ‘Chiu nagoon,’ existed before
the first year of Mun moo. But authentic records of
that period do not remain in existence at the present time.
In old times there was a separate office of religion known as
the ‘Jin ngi kwang’ or ‘Kami no tskasa,’ answering to
the ‘Ta chang sz’ in China. The two officers who superintended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
the rites in worship of the gods were above all
other officers. This was the pristine custom in the kingdom
of spirits (Japan), arising from the reverence paid to the
gods of heaven and the spirits of earth.</p>

<p>“In the earliest times the Emperor Zinmu established
the capital within the bounds of the province of Yamato, at
Kashiwarra. At that time, in the beginning, Ten shio dai
shin (the heaven-illuminating spirit) came down and placed
three things—a ball or seal, an eight-cubit mirror, and a
grass-shaving sword—in the palace, on the throne of the
Emperor, which received homage such as was offered in early
times. The efficacy of the spirit was great, so that the Emperor
dwelling with the spirit was, as it were, equal to a
god. Within the palace these three emblems were placed in
safety, that it might be said that where these are there is
divine power. At this time two high officers, ‘Ama no koya
ne no mikoto’ and ‘Ama no tane ko mikoto,’ regulated the
sacrificial rites and court ceremonies, until the time of the
Emperor Soui-zin (97-30 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), who, fearing the majesty of
the divinity, took away these three efficacious symbols, the
sword and the seal and the mirror, and put them elsewhere
(<i>i.e.</i>, in a palace he built at Miako); which was the origin
of the idea of the Emperor’s sitting like a god in the place
of a god.</p>

<p>“In the reign of Swee nin (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 29-70) the great spirit
Tenshio, or Ten shio dai jin, descended upon the province of
Isse (when the Emperor measured and divided that province),
and that Emperor built and endowed the temple or yashiro of
Isse. This is the most sacred temple in the empire.</p>

<p>“At that time the O nakatomi family were hereditary
officers of religion, and of rites of worship.</p>

<p>“After the officers of state had been appointed, the officers
of the Jin ngi kwang, or spiritual department, were settled.
Originally the Jin ngi kwang was the highest department of
all. The temple built by the Emperor at Isse had separate
officers of worship, and as to duties, both regulated worship;
the offices were similar in their origin and character, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
department of religion was of the highest importance. Therefore,
in the kingdom of spirits (<i>i.e.</i>, Japan) these officers of
religion ranked above all other officers. At that time a man
of the fourth rank could be an officer of religion, but now it
is confined to the second and third ranks. Formerly, any
one was considered capable of filling the office, Nakatomi
or other; but in the middle ages, since the time of the
Emperor Kwa sann, it became hereditary in the family of
his son, and no other family could fill the office; and it has
since been filled by the members of the royal family.</p>

<p>“Originally the name Nakatomi designated an office.
When one of the holders was made Oodai jin, he added O
(great) to his title; but his descendants did not use the title,
therefore they are simply called Nakatomi.”</p>

<p>Such is the introduction to the “Book of the Government
of the Empire.” What follows is the names of the different
offices, and ranks of officers, whether civil or military, stating
what rank is eligible to hold each office, what offices can
be held in conjunction by the same person, together with the
Chinese equivalent of each title wherever it can be given.</p>

<p>Every office in Japan is divided into four—a head and
three subordinates. The head is called by various titles,
Kio, Kami, Tayu, Daiboo, etc. The highest subordinate is
called Skay or Ske—in Chinese, Tsu—to assist or help; or
Kai, to attend upon; also Tso, to assist: all three characters
are used. The next is Jo—Chinese, Shing, to assist—deputy.
The clerks are called Sakkan—Chinese, Shuh—attached to
as a tail, dependent on. Each of these may be subdivided
into great and small, Dai and Sho; and further, frequently
into sa and oo—<i>i.e.</i>, left and right. Besides these official
grades, the title of Gong, or Gonno, is found. This seems
to be an honorific title, and is generally conferred by the
Emperor upon Koongays and persons about his own court.
It seems to mean honorary substitute or deputy, and is added
or prefixed to another title. This is the word K’ün in Chinese,
with the meaning of power, balance, temporary substitute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>With these explanations it may be possible to understand
the titles and descriptions of offices and officers given in the
Shoku gen sho.</p>

<p>The first or highest office was that of religion, or board
of rites, the Jin ngi kwang (shin k’i kwan), the office of the
worship of spirits. This office, at first entirely for regulation
of the Sinto religion, was rendered unnecessary by the introduction
of Buddhism, and has been practically done away
with—the higher titles and larger emoluments being absorbed
by the younger sons of royal families, while the working
part of the board has been joined with the highest board,
Dai jo gwang.</p>

<p>The Dai jo gwang, or Matsuri koto tskasa, is the great
office of government. This is the “cabinet,” and is over and
superintends the eight boards and the affairs of the whole
empire. The chief of the department is the Dai jo dai jin—the
great minister of the whole government. He is also
called Sho koku. This office is not always filled up. The
holder is in settled times nearly invariably one of the “five
families.” This is the highest office in the state, and was
commenced by the Emperor Ten shi, who conferred it on his
son. When this office is vacant, the next in rank, the Sa dai
jin (left great minister) is highest official in point of rank.
The highest subject generally receives at the Emperor’s
hands the title of Kwanbakku, first given <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 880. The
Kwanbakku is always near the Emperor’s person, and not
engaged so much as others on public business. If the sovereign
be a minor or a female, a regent is appointed, who is
naturally the most powerful subject in the empire. He is
named Sessio, or Setz jio, helper of the government. When
such a regent is appointed for a young Empress, it is generally
intended that he is to marry her, and become Emperor.
The Kwanbakku was, in old times, called Omurazi. He is
frequently spoken of as Denga sama. The Dai jo dai jin
is commonly known as Sho koku, the Sa dai jin as Sa foo
sama, Oo dai jin as Eoo foo sama, Nai dai dai jin as Nai or
Dai foo sama. There may be only one of the three titles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
Dai jio dai jin, Kwanbakku, or Sessio, conferred at a time;
but whoever holds it is known to be the highest official, and
he may have all three titles at the same time. The office
of Dai jio dai jin has frequently remained vacant for lengthened
periods.</p>

<p>In the Dai jio gwang there are four ministers. Dai jin
means great minister, and the prefix of Sa is left, of Oo is
right. In Japan the left generally takes precedence. And
these four stand in this relation to one another. The first
three are known as the “Sanko,” or three exalted ones.
There is another officer, that of Nai dai jin, inner or middle
great minister. This office is filled up if there be no
Dai jio dai jin; but if otherwise it remains in abeyance.</p>

<p>Since 1780 the Shiogoon has generally been elevated to
be Oodai jin or Sadai jin.</p>

<p>The next officer below the Oodai jin is the Dai na goon.
There are ten of them. They act with the Sanko in the Dai
jo gwang office. They seem to be the mouthpieces to and
from the board, and in consultation with the board. They
are generally Koongays. But some of the highest Daimios
are competent for the office, Owarri, Kishiu, and Mito.</p>

<p>The Chiu (or middle) na goon—ten officers of much lower
rank than the last—never deliberate with the board, but are
consulted after or before. They are generally Koongays.</p>

<p>The Sangi (Ts’an i), also called Sei sho and Gisso (I tsau),
is a very important office—eight officers. They are of high
rank (above the last), and are chosen for their talent for the
office. This seems to be to report upon the proceedings and
conclusions of the other officers of the board; to watch and
also advise, and sometimes to act as judges. They are both
civil and military. If a man has shown himself qualified
for this office he may rise to it, though not originally of high
rank.</p>

<p>The Sho (or lesser) nagoon are much below the above
officers in rank. They are said to help the memories of the
principal officers, to put seals to deeds, and carry communications
to other boards: they are both military and civil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>Gayki or Kwanmu—five officers who act as secretaries to
one of the three officers of the Dai jo ngwang. Divided into
great and small, Dai and Sho, gayki; the head man is called
Kioo ku mu. The duties consist in writing out the patents
and titles conferred by the Mikado. In cases of dispute between
high officers, they seem to write out a statement of the
case on both sides for the decision of the board. They look
after any newly-introduced business, such as introduction of
foreigners to the country.</p>

<p>Ben-gwang, seven officers, all Koongay—a higher office
than the preceding. Two head men, left and right, Sa and
Oo dai ben. This is a very responsible office; all the business
of the board passes through the hands of the officers.
They superintend and set apart to each of the minor offices
their business.</p>

<p>Sa chiu ben and Oo chiu ben, two men.</p>

<p>Sa sho ben and Oo sho ben, two men.</p>

<p>These are subordinates in the office, but men of rank.</p>

<p>Gonno ben. This is an honorific title, giving high rank,
but having no business or duties to perform.</p>

<p>The Ben-gwang officers are always in their handsome
official dress, and are at once recognizable on the street.</p>

<p>Shi, eight men. Their business is to act as bookkeepers
or registrars of the transactions of the board; they take
charge of the books, and are referred to for information of
past transactions.</p>

<p>Sa and Oo dai shi, four men.</p>

<p>Si sho, twenty men, attendants of the three high officers.</p>

<p>Kwa jo, four men, attendants of the Ben-gwang. Though
low, the office is an important one.</p>

<h3>HATCH SHIO, THE EIGHT BOARDS</h3>

<p>The eight boards under the Dai jo gwang are:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>1. Nakatskasa no sho. </td><td>             5. Hio bu sho (Ch., Ping po).</td></tr>
<tr><td>2. Siki bu sho (Ch., Li po). </td><td>       6. Gio bu sho (Ch., Ying po).</td></tr>
<tr><td>3. Ji bu sho (Ch., Li po). </td><td>         7. Okura no sho (Ch., Ta fu sz).</td></tr> 
<tr><td>4. Min bu sho (Ch., U po). </td><td>         8. Koo nai sho (Ch., Kung po).</td></tr> 
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>I. Nakatskasa no sho, or Naka no matsuri koto suru
tskasa (equivalent office in China, Chang shu shang).—The
Board of the Interior Government, superintends the palace
and the affairs of the Emperor, and regulates the imperial
household.</p>

<p>The head man, Nakatskasa no kio, is always of very high
rank—generally a son of the Emperor, or of one of the royal
families.</p>

<p>Nakatskasa no ta yu, chamberlain of the household.</p>

<p>Nakatskasa no gonno tayu is always a Mayka no tenjio
bito koongay.</p>

<p>Nakatskasa no shoyu.</p>

<p>Nakatskasa no gonno shoyu.</p>

<p>Nakatskasa no dai and sho jio, subordinates of the above.</p>

<p>Nakatskasa no dai and sho sakkan, secretaries.</p>

<p>Dji jiu, eight men of high rank.</p>

<p>Wo do neri, ninety men of low rank; clean rooms, etc.</p>

<p>Neiki, writers to the Emperor’s dictation, or for his perusal
on government business; correspond about conferring rank,
and write out documents connected with this. They are
always able men, and any man may rise to fill this office
if he shows talent.</p>

<p>Dai neiki, one man; sho neiki, two men; the latter subordinates
and successors of the former.</p>

<p>Kemmootz, Dai and Sho, two men.</p>

<p>These are the reporters or spies (ometskys) upon the officers
of the whole board—literally, lookers into things (kien wuh).</p>

<p>Sho den, one man of low rank to superintend the servants
and to see that rooms are cleaned, etc.</p>

<p>Kangee no tskasa, keepers of the keys, now done away
with.</p>

<p>Included under this department are the establishments of
the Emperor’s grandmother, mother, and wife. These are
called the Shi ngoo—four offices.</p>

<p>The office of the Emperor’s grandmother is Tai kwo tai
kowu goo siki, the great Emperor’s great Empress’s office.</p>

<p>That of the mother, Kwo tai kowu goo siki.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>That of the wife having a child, Kwo tai kowu goo siki.</p>

<p>That of the wife before she has a child, Chiu ngoo siki.</p>

<p>The ladies rank as Dai nagoon.</p>

<p>Under the Nakatskasa no shio there are several minor
hoards or rio.</p>

<p>O do neri no rio.—In this office there were formerly 800
men about the court, as messengers, servants, etc.</p>

<p>Odoneri no kami, Ske, etc.</p>

<p>Dsu sho rio, surveying office for plans of houses, maps of
towns, country, harbors, seas, etc.</p>

belonging to the palace—a responsible office.</p>

<p>Officers—Koora no kami, K. no gonno kami, K. no
ske, etc.</p>

<p>Noo ee rio superintends the making of the clothes and
sewing generally of the palace.</p>

<p>Noo ee no kami, N. no ske, N. no gonno ske, etc.</p>

<p>Ro koku haka se, keeper of time by the clepsydra; teacher

<p>Taku mi rio, office of the carpenters, woodworkers. Taku
mi no kami, etc.</p>

<p>Palaces, temples, houses and bridges in Japan being, for
fear of earthquakes, nearly entirely built of wood, the trade
of carpenter rises to a science, and, including architecture
and engineering, is a business or profession which is held in
high respect.</p>

<p>In the official list mention is not made of the head man
of the tanner class, or that which deals in skins of dead
animals, which occupation is an abomination to the pure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
Buddhist. The name of the class is Yayta. They live in
Yayta mura or village of skinners, often called Yakunin
mura. The head man is Kobowozi. His duty is to go every
day to the palace and clear away all dead animals—rats,
mice, birds. He wears two swords and is generally handsomely
dressed. The class belongs to the Ikkoshiu sect of
Buddhists. Some of the men following this trade are very
rich. Teikoya in Osaka and Siroyama in Yedo are both
wealthy. The head skinner of the “eight provinces,” Danza
yay mong, claims to be descended from Yoritomo. He also
is reputed to be very wealthy, exercising great power over
his own trade, which is governed by its own laws. Living
in a fine house near the Yosiwara in Yedo, he is a despotic
ruler, and can punish with death those under him. His private
chapel or Bootzu dang is said to be the finest in Yedo.</p>

<p>II. Siki bu shio (Chinese, Shik po shang; Chinese equivalent
office, Li po), the Board of Civil Office. Has legislative
functions, and under this board is the department of public
instruction and the college. The head man of the board is
the Siki bu kio. He is generally a Sinwo, or a member of
the imperial family. If the Kio be an able, energetic man,
his position enables him to obtain great power, and he may
become the first man in the empire. Formerly, men known
by the name Si sho were sent by the board to all the provinces
to report on the government of each. They were
changed every four years, but the custom has become
obsolete.</p>

<p>Siki bu no Tayu.</p>

<p>Siki bu no Gonno Tayu, both men of high rank, who
practically carry on the business of the board.</p>

<p>Siki bu no Sho yu and Gonno sho yu, etc.</p>

<p>Under this board is the Dai gaku rio (Ch. equivalent,
Kwoh tsz kien), office of instruction or education. The head
man is Dai gaku no kami. This office is divided into four
sub-classes, which have to do with the instruction conveyed
in books and literature to the people.</p>

<p>Shiu goku ji—prison department.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>Shiu goku no kami, ske, etc.</p>

<p>As this title is supposed to convey some disgrace with it,
no one considers it an honor, and therefore it is generally
combined with some other.</p>

<p>VII. Okura no shio (Chinese office, Tafu sz), officer over
the imperial storehouses and granaries.</p>

<p>Isse no sei goo rio, or Sei ki no mia no tskasa. This was
an old office in connection with the Emperor’s daughters,
who officiated as priestesses at Isse. It is now obsolete. In
the year 5 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the Emperor Sei Nin established his daughter
at Isse as priestess of the temple he had built in honor
of Ten shio dai jin. He gave her the title of Seigoo or
Sai koo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>Shun siki (Ch., siu li chih), carpenters of the Buddhist
temples.</p>

<p>Shuri no daibu. This office is filled by the Daimio of
Satsuma, “Shimadzu shuri no daibu.”</p>

<p>Sh. no gonno daibu, etc.</p>

<p>Kangay yushi. This seems to be a military board of deliberation.
Kangay yu no cho gwang of high rank.</p>

<p>Kangay yu no ji kwang, one man of high rank, generally
a Ben gwang. This is a very high office; the officers are
always known from their fine dress.</p>

<p>K. no hang gwang, military secretaries in the office.</p>

<p>Shuzen shi, the Mint.</p>

<p>The Mint is not now at Miako, but at Yedo, where the
Shiogoon’s officers keep it in their own hands.</p>

<p>Shuri goo jo shi, superintendent of Sintoo temples or
mias. Head officer is always a Ben gwang.</p>

<p>Dzo ji shi, superintendents of Buddhist temples.</p>

<p>Bo wo ngashi, military man, superintends the banks of
the Kamongawa, a river at Miako. Is at the same time Ta
yee no ske.</p>

<p>Se yaku in, doctors for the poor in Miako.</p>

<p>Ke bi ishi, Police and Executive. The Kangay yu no cho,
the Gio bu shio, and the Kebi ishi, are now merged in one
department, to which all the Kokushiu Daimios, the Dai jo
gwang, Giobushio, the Ometski, and city governors belong,
and is very important.</p>

<p>The head officer is Kebi ishi no bettowo, a military man
of higher rank than the Sanghi. There is a saying that a
Kebi ishi no bettowo should have seven virtues. These
seven virtues, the book remarks, it is very difficult to find
in one man. K. no bettowo is one of the men with most
power over the natives in the empire.</p>

<p>K. no ske, two men. They are commonly known as Ta
yee no ske, and every one in Miako can recognize them at
once by their dress.</p>

<p>Then follow the titles of men as heads of some of the
large families or clans of Japan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>Fusi wara ooji no choja (chang shang), the head of the
clan Fusiwara. By men of this clan all high civil offices
are filled. The offices of Sessio and Kwanbakku are filled
by members of this family. When the country is torn by
civil war, then he who gets the power may take the title, as
in the case of Taiko sma and his son.</p>

<p>Genji no Choja, the head of the family of Gen. Gen and
Minnamoto are the same name (Ch., un, a spring of water).
It is supposed to be pre-eminently military, and having
gained the upper hand in the long civil wars with the He
family, it has advanced in honor, especially under the present
dynasty of Shiogoons, who call themselves Minnamoto.</p>

<p>The Shiogoon is Minnamoto no choja, and as holding this
title he now is also Shiungaku in no bettowo, or principal
of the college of Shiungaku in, formerly in Miako, now in
Yedo. He is also head of the college Joone wa in.</p>

<p>Then follow some of the officers more immediately about
the Emperor’s person.</p>

<p>Nai keoo bo no bettowo, office of music for the ladies,
generally held by a man of high rank, with some knowledge
of music.</p>

<p>Nai zen no bettowo, examiner or presenter of the Emperor’s
food, of high rank.</p>

<p>Mi dzu shi dokoro no bettowo, superintendent of the
kitchen in the palace, is always Kura no kami.</p>

<p>O oota dokoro no bettowo, superintendent of singing
and poetry, an officer of very high rank, sometimes one of
the royal family.</p>

<p>Ki roku dokoro no bettowo. Every day there meet in
the Emperor’s study, or Ki roku, this officer, who is of
Koongio rank, one of the Ben gwang, one Kaiko, and one
Yori oodo, who come to write for the Emperor.</p>

<p>Kaku sho no bettowo, superintendent of a certain kind
of music (Yoh).</p>

<p>Kuro wu do or Kurodo dokoro, an important department
in the palace. The Emperor Saga, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 810, commenced
the office. The officers seem to be noble attendants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
on the Emperor’s person, and to appear about him
when in public.</p>

<p>Kurodo no Bettowo is an office held by one of the highest
ministers—Kwanbakku or Sadaijin.</p>

<p>Kurodo no To (or Tono kurodo dokoro), two officers, one
Ben gwang, one military.</p>

<p>Go-i (fifth rank) kuro do dokoro, three officers, civilians,
always rise from this to higher rank: first, to Hatch shio no
ske, then to Kangay yu no jikang, to Kebe ishi no ske, to
Tono Kurodo, and to Sanghi. Therefore this place is sought
after by the Kindatchi (sons of Go sekkay), as it brings them
prominently forward; but it is an office requiring great energy
and exactness, and mistakes are apt to bring the officer into
trouble. The dress of the K. no To is somewhat similar in
color to the Emperor’s.</p>

<p>Roko-i (sixth rank) no kurodo, four officers. Must be
sons of Shodaibu (fifth rank); must be able and of good
courage, and steady men. The first officer gets as his perquisite
the kikuji no ho, the used outer clothes of the Emperor,
of yellow and green colors mixed. One of the lower
officers gets the inner white silk dress, which is changed
every day. The Emperor never wears linen or cotton.</p>

<p>Hi kurodo, many, all of low rank, and are the men-servants
of the palace.</p>

<p>Ko do neri, lower servants.</p>

<p>Dzo siki, military officers, young men, guards of the
kurodo.</p>

<p>Tokoro no shiu, attendants.</p>

<p>Take ngootchi, private soldiers.</p>

<p>Then follows another short historical notice of the Sho
koku, all the provinces of Japan, to the effect that formerly
all Japan belonged to the Emperor Zin mu, who was, before
becoming Emperor, a (kami yoh) god. He came from
Miazaki in Fiuga, and at the time Japan was wild and barbarous.
He fought his way to Yamato, and made his capital
Kashiwara.</p>

<p>At the time of the tenth Emperor, Shiu jin, Kashiwara<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
existed. He sent embassies to all the separate princes of
Japan. He appointed four generals of the north, south, east
and west, Si dono shiogoon, and, war ensuing, he conquered
all Japan.</p>

<p>Emperor Say mu, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 150, the thirteenth after Zin mu,
appointed rulers over the country. These were then called
“Kooni no miatsko,” and he subsequently divided the empire
into provinces. These lords were afterward called “Koku
shiu,” and again were known as “Kami to you.”</p>

<p>The provinces were divided into—</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>Gay koku, inferior provinces.<br>
Dai koku, large provinces.<br>
Jo koku, superior provinces.<br>
Chiu koku, central provinces.<br>
Ki nai koku, the five provinces round Miako.</p>
</div>

<p>To each of these there were appointed officers—kami, jo,
ske, and sakkan.</p>

<p>The provinces were classed together as To kai do (eastern
sea-road), fifteen provinces—1, Iga; 2, Isse; 3, Sima; 4,
Owarri; 5, Mikawa; 6, Tootomi; 7, Suruga; 8, Idzu; 9,
Kahi; 10, Segami; 11, Musasi; 12, Awa; 13, Kadsusa; 14,
Simosa; 15, Hitatsi.</p>

<p>To sando (eastern Highland), eight provinces—1, Oomi;
2, Mino; 3, Hida; 4, Sinano; 5, Kowodsuki; 6, Simodsuki;
7, Mootz; 8, Dewa.</p>

<p>Dewa and Mootz are large outlying provinces, and one
Kami is not sufficient, therefore another office is established
there, “Azetshi no foo.” Originally Mootz and Dewa were
one. About <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 713, in the time of the Empress Gen mei,
Mootz was divided; and the Empress Gen Sio, who succeeded,
created the office of Azetshi shi; and the Emperor
Sio mu added Chinji foo and Fooku shio goong, and Goon
king and Goon so. Azetshi shi is the chief officer of Mootz,
and is of high rank.</p>

<p>Azetshi shi no keji, his secretary.</p>

<p>Chin ji foo is another officer in these provinces, of which
the head officer is named Chin no shiogoong. The Diamio<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
known as “Sendai” is the head man of these provinces, and,
as Kami of Mootz, is known also as Fooku shiogoong.</p>

<p>In these provinces are the two officers Akita no jo and
Ske. The Emperor Sio mu built a fortress at Akita, and
appointed an officer in charge. Dewa no ske and Akita no
ske are different titles of the same officer.</p>

<p>Hoku roku do, north-country provinces route. Seven
provinces—1, Wakasa; 2, Etsizen; 3, Kanga; 4, Noto; 5,
Etjiu; 6, Etsingo; 7, Sado.</p>

<p>San in do. The back or north Highland route. Eight
provinces—1, Tamba; 2, Tango; 3, Tajima; 4, Inaba; 5,
Hoki; 6, Idzumo; 7, Iwami; 8, Oki.</p>

<p>San yo do. The fore or south Highland route. Eight
provinces—1, Harima; 2, Mimmesaka; 3, Bizen; 4, Bitsjiu;
5, Bingo; 6, Aki; 7, Suwo; 8, Nagato.</p>

<p>Nankai do. Southern sea route. Six provinces—1, Kii;
2, Awadsi; 3, Awa; 4, Sanuki; 5, Iyo; 6, Tosa.</p>

<p>Sei kai do. Western sea route in Kiusiu. Eleven provinces—1,
Tsikuzen; 2, Tsikugo; 3, Hizen; 4, Higo; 5, Buzen;
6, Bungo; 7, Fiuga; 8, Osumi; 9, Satsuma; 10, Iki; 11,
Tsusima.</p>

<p>The Emperor Siomu created an office in the island of
Kiusiu, Da zai fu, but it is now done away with. All the
lords of that island were formerly required to come to Miako
once every four years.</p>

<p>Military department. The imperial guards are called Sho
ye (Ch., Chu wei,) “all keep.”</p>

<p>Sa kon ye fu, and Oo k., office of the left and right
guards. A military office is Jing, or Goong, or Oo rin goong,
or Ye fu no jing.</p>

<p>Tai sho, generally commander-in-chief of the army, is
sometimes called Shiogoon and Baku foo, is always of the
highest rank, his office making him of equal rank with the
Sadaijin.</p>

<p>Besides the Tai sho there are two officers, the Sa and Oo
daisho; sometimes called Sakonye no taisho. The Sadaisho
is the superior officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>Chiujo, lieutenant-generals of the guards, four, or at
times six, officers.</p>

<p>Sa kon ye no Chiujo and Oo kon ye, men of high rank.</p>

<p>Shojo (small general), major-general. Of these there are
eight or ten. Are also of high rank, especially if appointed
while young.</p>

<p>Shogeng. Military officers of inferior rank to the above.</p>

<p>Shoso. Secretaries; adjutants.</p>

<p>Banjiu. Also called Konye no to neri—servants. All
the officers above are near the Emperor as guards.</p>

<p>Gay ye. Outer guards.</p>

<p>The office is Sa (and Oo) ye mon no foo. The Emperor
Sanga changed the name from Ye ji no foo.</p>

<p>Sa ye mon no Kami.</p>

<p>Sa ye mon no ske, etc.</p>

<p>So (or Oo) hio ye no foo is another office.</p>

<p>Sa (or Oo) hio ye no Kami is head officer of high rank.
This officer is frequently mentioned by the Jesuits.</p>

<p>Sa hio ye no ske.</p>

<p>Oo hio ye no ske, etc.</p>

<p>Soma rio or Sa-oo ma rio. The office of right or left
superintendent of the cavalry.</p>

<p>Sa ma no Kami; Oo ma no Kami. Both of high rank.</p>

<p>Sa ma no gonno Kami; Oo ma no gonno Kami.</p>

<p>Ske and Gonno Ske. These take rank above all other ske.</p>

<p>Sa and Oo ma no dai jo and shojo. This is the first rank
attained by a commissioned officer in the army.</p>

<p>Hio ngo rio. Ordnance storehouse.</p>

<p>Hio no Kami. One officer.</p>

<p>Gay boo no Kwang. The outer military department.
The army in distinction from the guards.</p>

<p>The annals of the army are very ancient. In Tenshio
dai jin’s time, the title of the commander-in-chief was Fu
dzu nushino kami, known by his posthumous honors and title
as Kashima Mio jin in Hitatsi province. The title of Shiogoon
(tsiang kiun) was first used by the Emperor Shiu jin
50 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> In the Emperor Kei ko’s time, his son, Yamato<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
taki no mikoto, was dai shiogoon, and there were two others,
Sa and Oo shiogoon. This Yamato overran all Japan and
the island of Yezo, also the three countries of Sinra, Corea,
and Haxai or Hiakusai, provinces of what is now known as
Corea, and put into them Japanese offices and officers; and
after that commenced Goonfoo or military offices, or, in
short, a standing army.</p>

<p>Chinjiu foo. Office for northern provinces. C. no Shiogoon,
an officer who is general and commander-in-chief in
the provinces of Mootz and Dewa. Mootz no Kami (Sendai)
is generally the hereditary Shiogoon of these provinces. He
is bound to keep, in the two provinces, an army of 5,000 men.</p>

<p>Chinji foo no fooku shiogoon is an officer called out only
during war.</p>

<p>Chinji foo no goon kan, etc.</p>

<p>Se i dai Shiogoon (Ch., Tsing i ta tsiang kiun), tranquilizer
of barbarians; great army general. Yamato take no
mikoto was the first called Tai shiogoon. Se i was a title first
given to Bunya no wata maro for bringing all the wild northern
part of Japan under rule. This is the officer known to
foreigners as Tycoon.</p>

<p>See i shi. The office of the tranquilizer of barbarians.</p>

<p>Sei fu is one name by which the Shiogoon’s castle in Yedo
is known. This title—and it is now only a title—has for long
been in the Minnamoto family. Yoritomo was Sei Shiogoon
(not Kubosama, as Kæmpfer says).</p>

<p>Sinwo. Imperial families; previously explained.</p>

<p>Koongio. This class includes all of the first three ranks,
and Sanghi, though of fourth rank. Only three men have
been of the first rank and first class while alive, Tatchibanna
moroye, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 749; Fusiwara no Oshikatz, 762, a great tyrant;
and Nangatte, so bad a man that the book will not say when
he lived, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 770, 780. These three men all lived and rose
to power one after the other during the reign of Koken the
Empress. This woman is notorious in Japanese history for
her outrage of morality in her conduct with Dokio, a priest.
She seems to have shown talent and capacity in her public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
position, and reascended the throne as Shio toku after one
abdication.</p>

<p>Daijodaijin, Kwanbakku, Sessio, Sa and Oo daijin, previously
explained.</p>

<p>Sho shin, all beneath the third rank, including Tenjio bito
and Jeengay, being so called, includes some Koongays and
all the Daimios.</p>

<p>Kindatchi, sons of the Gosekkay.</p>

<p>Sho dai bu, officers of the fifth rank and below.</p>

<p>Samurai are all military men and civilians who are independent
of trade or farming.</p>

<p>The Emperor’s wife has the title of Ko-ngoo.</p>

<p>The Emperor’s widow has the title of Nioying.</p>

<p>The Emperor’s daughter has the title of Nei shin wo.</p>

<p>The female attendants are called Jo wo ro.</p>

<p>The female inferiors are called Ko jowo ro and Chiu ro.</p>

<p>The female lowest class are called Gay ro.</p>

<p>Then follow the titles of Buddhist officials in temples,
such as—1, Dai so jo, equal in rank to Shanghi; 2, Ho yin;
3, Ho-moo; 4, Sowodz and Gonno Sowodz; 5, Ho-ngong;
6, Ris shi.</p>

<p>There are different titles of inferior orders of priests who
have to do with ritual, worship, funerals, etc.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The above gives an imperfect sketch of the offices, with
the titles, ranks, and degrees, of the officers connected with
the government of Japan. Such information is at the best
uninteresting; but when it is conveyed in names which have
no meaning, it becomes, without some practical acquaintance
with the country, as difficult as it is useless to attempt to
master the subject. But to one living in the country this
knowledge is indispensable, and even for reading the letters
of the old Jesuits, who seem to have been thoroughly acquainted
with the names in common use by the people, some
such information is very needful. Thus we find, among
many others, they speak of Toronosqui as Cauzuye dono,
and of Don Austin as Chikara dono, titles which are rendered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
in the above list as Kadznyay no Kami and Chikara
no Kami. These titles, as has been said, are in use at the
present day, but they refer more to the old form of government
of Miako, which has been supplanted by the more
recent imitation of it at Yedo. The latter having retained
the whole executive in its hands, the mere form has been left
to Miako. Now, when the country has begun to have relations
with foreign countries, the difficulty of the double government
is hanging over the rulers, who have not yet seen
that one must be swept away as a thing no longer required.
The two parts of the double government come into collision
in presence of third powers. The Government of Yedo is
still to be explained, and the reader will then be able to see
how far the opposing interests of the two capitals throw
difficulties in the way of smooth progress.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>HISTORY OF THE EMPIRE TO THE DEATH OF NOBU NANGA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> period of the history of Japan which has most interest
to a European is that during which intercourse was carried
on with Europe. But, independently of this new and
interesting element introduced into the country, this is, even
to a Japanese, the period of the history of his country which
has most interest. It was the termination of a long succession
of bloody civil wars, during which the whole empire was
deluged with blood, lasting long enough to make the country
a desert, the inhabitants savages, when agriculture was totally
neglected, and the knowledge of letters nearly forgotten.
Family ties were broken; young men were all soldiers; young
women were common property. The Japanese may well
look upon the man raised up, and who proved himself able
to put an end to such a state of things, as a hero, and think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
his family worthy of the highest honors. To reduce order
out of chaos, to insure his country 250 years of peace, during
which time every one has been able to sit under his own vine,
and to rear his family in happiness, and gather in the fruits
of his labor in peace, may well rank Iyeyas as among the
illustrious of men.</p>

<p>It is necessary, in order to understand the working of the
government as it exists at present, to have some knowledge
of the events which preceded and gradually led up to the
period when this change began.</p>

<p>In the works of Klaproth and Kæmpfer will be found
notes of the earlier historical events occurring in Japan.
What follows here is derived from these and other sources,
and is an attempt to notice some of the more prominent important
events, and to give some interest to the subject by
bringing it down to the present time. It is unnecessary in
such a sketch to go back to the time of remote antiquity,
or to try to get glimmerings of light out of fables, such as
the different generations of heavenly and earthly emperors.
To notice shortly the more prominent characters and events
may be deemed sufficient.</p>

<p>Among the first of these prominent characters was Yamato
Daki no Mikoto, prince of warriors, commander-in-chief, and
of the imperial family. He is supposed to have lived during
the second century. He overran the eastern and northern
parts of Japan as far as the island of Yezo. A story is told
of his wife having thrown herself into the sea to appease a
storm, and from his lamentations over her, as Atsuma or
Adzuma, the eastern provinces are spoken of as Adzuma,
now sometimes applied to the east generally, and more specially
to the inhabitants, who are spoken of as Adzuma Yebis,
or “boors of the east,” by way of contempt.</p>

<p>Another of these early events in the history of Japan,
which bears an interest even to the present day, is the invasion
and conquest of the southern part of Corea by the Empress
Jingu kogu, known by her husband’s name as Chiu ai
tenwo, in the third century. The Emperor, her husband,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
was the son of the above-mentioned Yamato. She accompanied
him to the island of Kiusiu, whither he went to put
down a rebellion among some tributary states; but before
the operation was accomplished he died, and she assumed
the reins of power. Her prime minister was an old man,
Take ootsi no Sukonne. After raising troops, and collecting
ships to transport them across the sea, she found herself pregnant,
but she was fortunate enough to find a stone which delayed
her accouchement till her return to Japan. Having
subdued the three countries of Sinra, Korai, and Hakusai, and
compelled them to give up their treasures and to promise
to pay annual tribute to Japan, she returned to bury her deceased
husband, and was soon after delivered of a son, who
was afterward the Emperor Osin, known better by his posthumous
title of Hatchimang. Two older sons of her husband
by a concubine, asserting their rights of primogeniture,
and probably doubting the virtues of the stone, raised an
army to oppose the Empress. Take ootsi was sent to defend
her rights, and he put them to flight.</p>

<p>There is no incident more frequently taken for a subject
by painters in Japan than the Empress Jingu and her infant
in the arms of the aged Take ootsi. She is worshiped under
the name of Kashi no dai mio jin; but though her victories
threw more luster over the arms of Japan, in foreign warfare,
than any previous reign, or, it may be added, any subsequent
one, she does not seem to rank so high in the estimation
of her subjects, or in the company of the gods, as her
son. During his reign, Wonin—descended from one of the
Emperors of China of the Han dynasty—is said to have introduced
for the first time Chinese letters from Corea. His
tomb stands in the neighborhood of Osaka, and divine honors
have been accorded to him. As has been remarked, it may
be doubted how far the Japanese, with their previous use
of Chinese titles and names of gods, officers and men, could
have been ignorant up to this time of the art of writing. To
the Emperor Osin, though unborn, appears to have been
given the credit of the conquest of Corea. After his death,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 313, divine honors were paid to him. He was styled
and worshiped as the god of war, and under the title Hatchimang-dai
Bosats he is represented as an incarnation of the
Buddha of the eight banners. The largest temples have
been raised in his honor, and every village, almost every
hill, has its Hatchimang goo or shrine in honor of Hatchimang,
the god of war.</p>

<p>The introduction of Buddhism was the next event of importance
in the history of Japan. This is said to have taken
place toward the middle of the sixth century. But it may
be presumed, when the Emperor receives the posthumous
honor of a Bosat, or Bodhisattwa, in the fourth century,
either that the title was given long after his decease, or that
the religion was beginning to be introduced at an earlier
epoch. In all probability Wonin, who had access to the imperial
family, and must have had great influence, had sown
the seeds of the new doctrine, and had given the title to his
patron. These seeds may not have borne fruit for 200 years;
but considering the communication in past times with China,
it is difficult to conceive total ignorance of these doctrines. To
Corea, therefore, Japan was again indebted for a religion. In
the year 552, during the reign of the Emperor Kin mei, the
King of Hakkusai, a district of Corea, sent an embassy with
a present of an image of Buddha Sakya mooni, with Buddhist
books, to the Emperor. The priests of the old Sinto
religion were roused, but the new made its way. The Sinto
religion seems to be all prayers, without any idea of a being
to whom to pray beyond white paper, or a mirror, as an emblem
of purity. The Buddhist religion supplied this, and
presented what is required by many minds, the idea of a
pure life through self-denial—self-denial giving a man power
over himself, and enabling him to be the servant or the master
as his church may require. During the succeeding reign,
In consequence of an epidemic, some persecution of the new
doctrines was attempted; but Moumaya do no wosi, son of
the Emperor, being a convert, was very zealous in the propagation
of the faith; while Nakatomi, then in power, and of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
the family who superintended the Sinto rites, opposed him.
But the son of the Emperor (known by his Buddhist name
Ziou go taisi, or Sho to ku tai si) prevailed. He was appointed
regent during the reign of the Empress Sui ko. He
was a very gentle character, strictly acting up to the injunctions
of the new faith. At his death, in the beginning of the
seventh century, there were, according to the Annales, 46
Buddhist temples, 816 priests, and 569 “religieuses” in the
empire.</p>

<p>The introduction of Buddhism through China and Corea
brought with it, as might have been expected, some of the
customs of these countries. The use of the Nengo (Nien
hau; <i>i.e.</i>, year name) for marking events and dates was one
of the customs introduced in the year 646 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> A woman
ruling as Empress was another of the changes, and was probably
used as a means for the consolidation of the new religion.
Under the Empress Sui ko the degrees of rank among
the officers of government, similar to those used in China,
were introduced about 604 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> Six ranks, of two grades
each, were settled in place of the nine ranks, of two grades
each, as in China. These were distinguished, as in China,
by their head-dress, and by the color of the dress. They
were called by the allegorical names of Virtue, Humanity,
Manners, Faith, Justice, Wit. The first Empress was followed
in no long time by a second, Kwo kogoo, and during
her reign she had the good fortune to have as a minister and
counselor Nakatomi-kamatar iko. He was not a Buddhist,
but had no doubt felt the influence which the spread of this
doctrine had exercised over Japan, and is reputed to this day
one of Japan’s greatest men, and looked up to as the founder
of her law. During a long life he seems to have steered
safely through the difficulties of politics—acting as counselor
to his mistress, Kwo kogoo, her brother who succeeded her,
Kwotoku, and again when his former mistress reascended
the throne as Zai mei, and subsequently her son Ten si—gaining
over those who might have been his opponents by
suavity and gentleness of demeanor. The last-named Emperor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
deplored his loss, and gave him the hereditary name
of Fusi wara, a family of which he was the founder. He
was canonized after death, and worshiped as Kassunga dai
mio jin, his temple being near Narra. During his life, and
the reign of Kwotoku, the eight boards were completed after
the model of the Lok po, or six boards of China.</p>

<p>Another change, which commenced after the introduction
of Buddhism, was the abdication of the Emperors after very
short reigns. This led again to the successive appointments
of mere children as Emperors. The ages at which several of
the Emperors, over a lengthened period, ascended the throne,
tended to reduce the position of Emperor to a name, and to
throw the entire power into the hands of the ministers. The
system began shortly after the introduction of Buddhism at
court, and the minds of the boys and women who successively
were nominal sovereigns of Japan were directed to the
study of books of the religion, to the erection of magnificent
temples, and to the manufacture of enormous idols and bells;
such as the enormous copper figures of Buddha at Narra,
Kamakura, and Miako. The latter has been melted down
and a wooden figure substituted. Such were the Empress
Sei wa, who began her reign at the age of nine; Yozei, who
commenced his at the age of eight; Daigo, at thirteen;
Reizan, a weakly lad of eighteen; Yenwou, at eleven; Go
itsi, at nine; Konye, at three; and Rokusio, at two. But
at intervals when a man ascended the throne, as the Emperor
Ten si, it is a relief to see that some energy remained
in the members of the royal family; and at times the national
vigor was shown, and the military spirit, which the people
are always proud of asserting, was fanned, by wars with
Dattang (or Tartary) and Corea in 658 and 661. About the
same time Yezo was once more overrun by Japanese arms
and brought into subjection, military stations and officers
being appointed in the island and in the hitherto barbarous
provinces of Mootz and Dewa, in the north of Nippon.
Revolts in the island of Kiusiu about 740 demanded fresh
action from the center, and tend to show what a loose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
hold this central power had at that time over the extremities
of the country. Not till the year 794 was this central
power finally fixed at Miako. About this year the Emperor
Kwan mu built a large palace there, finding that the magnitude
of the business transacted by the eight boards of the
empire demanded some settled place at which the court and
the heads of departments might be permanently located. To
the introduction of Buddhism and Chinese literature we may
ascribe the completion, by Fusiwara (Tankai ko), who died
in 720, of the “Ritz Rio,” a code of laws which are in force
and use at the present day. The introduction of an alphabet
or syllabary (the Hira Kana and Kata Kana) to facilitate the
reading and understanding of Chinese was the work of the
famous priest Ko bo, born in the province of Sanuki in 774,
and who died in 835. He was canonized as Kobo dai si, and
is venerated as one of the holiest saints of the Japanese calendar,
and consequently was very much abused by the Jesuits.
He spent some part of his life in China studying under
the Buddhists of the time, and brought with him, as many
others did, large numbers of Buddhist books. The enduring
property of Japanese paper and the absence of white ants
have preserved these, and doubtless in some of the libraries
of the country and Corea there may be found works of great
interest to the student of early Buddhist history in China and
India. The Issyekio or catalogue of all Buddhist canonical
books has been lately republished.</p>

<p>The custom grew gradually into use of the Emperor, after
his abdication, adopting the garb of a priest, shaving his
head, and retiring to a religious life. This seems to have
been in many cases merely nominal, as some retained not
only an interest, but took an active part, in the affairs of the
world; while to others the retirement was a relief and an
opening to license. The power, numbers, and wealth of the
Buddhist monasteries had vastly increased. They threatened
to monopolize the land of the empire; and the head of
a monastery was equal or superior to one of the most powerful
princes. Not only were the priests themselves living off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
these lands, but each of these establishments had a number
of retainers and soldiers sufficient to change the tide of success
in any engagement.</p>

<p>For three or four centuries the history of the empire may
be written in the successive rise to power of individuals of
the great families of the peerage—Fusiwara, Sungawara,
Minnamoto, Tatchibanna, and others. Names which are
regarded as illustrious in history, and held in veneration to
the present day, occasionally shine out, such as Kan sio jo,
better known by his posthumous title, Ten mang, the son
of Sungawar zay zen kio. He has the reputation of having
been a very able man, and was Kwan bakku and Nai dai jin.
Fusiwara no toki hira, ancestor of Koozio dono of the present
day, became very jealous of him, and Ten mang being of a
quiet disposition, Toka hira obtained an order for his banishment
to Dazai fu, in the island of Kiusiu. Here he retired
to the hill Ten pai zan, in Tsikuzen, and endeavored to get a
letter conveyed to the Emperor, but failed in doing so, and
was found starved to death on the 25th day of the second
month. A fable is told of letters having passed between him
and Haku raku teng, a Chinese poet, both letters being so
similar that only one word out of fourteen differed. The
repetition of the story in connection with the greatest literary
character of the country may show what admiration Chinese
literature was held in by the Japanese, and how it was considered
the standard of excellence. Ten mang occupies in
Japanese schools a somewhat similar position to that held
by Confucius in the Chinese. He is worshiped on the 25th
of each month, a day which is marked as a holiday. On the
anniversary a matsuri or festival is held—“Natane no goku.”
His posthumous title is Ten mang dai ji sei ten jin. His
descendants are known as Ten jin sang. Of temples to his
memory there is in Miako a fine one at Kitano, called also
Say bio, and in Yedo at Kame ido, and at Yooshima and
Shibba. In that at Miako the gilding and lacker are renewed
every fifty years. There is in it a large library, with
many old pieces of armor and spoils taken during the wars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
with Corea. These are exhibited annually on the mooshi
boshi day, “insect-brushing-away day,” when the temple is
cleaned.</p>

<p>Among others who made a name for themselves by their
bravery and other qualifications was Yoshi iye (son of Yori
yoshi, Prince of Mootz), one of the Minnamoto family, born
1057, and known in history by the appellation given him
by his enemies of Hatchi mang taro, or eldest son of the
god of war. His third son was Yoshi kooni, who settled at
Ashikanga, in the province of Simotsuki, and is the common
ancestor of the celebrated families of Ashikanga and Nitta.</p>

<p>In 1008 the Empress was one of the great clan of Minnamoto,
which was rising to power. The distant parts of the
empire were being consolidated by operations against rebels,
and the repeated transmission of large bodies of troops to the
different parts of the islands to put them down. This war
began to create an excitement or rivalry among some of the
leaders, who, when the rebellions were put down, had the
wish for more enemies to conquer, and could only turn
round in jealousy upon their equals. Yoshi iye was sent to
the province of Mootz as commander-in-chief, and, after
many years’ fighting, subdued the rebels, and brought this
province, as well as all the Kwanto (the provinces “east of
the barrier of Hakonay”), into submission. His son Tame
yoshi desired the same post. To Taira tada mori, descended
from the Emperor Kwan mu, was given the island of Tsussima,
and in 1153 his son Kio mori succeeded him as President
of the Criminal Tribunal. This name calls up, to any
one acquainted with Japanese history, the recollection of
the most stirring events and the greatest struggle which has
ever convulsed the empire of Japan. This struggle was
between the Gen or Minnamoto and the He or Taira families.
He and Taira are the same word in Japanese writing,
meaning “peace,” the former being the pronunciation of the
Chinese word ping. The Minnamoto family, or Gen ji, stood
on the broadest basis, and had risen to the greatest fame,
and had recently occupied the highest positions in the state.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
The Empress had been of the family, and the memoirs of the
family had been written for her edification or to gratify her
own or her family’s pride. On the other side, members of
the Taira family, or He ji, had occasionally risen up to high
rank in the state; and recently the family had been honored
for its prowess and its activity in the imperial service.</p>

<p>Yoshi tomo and Kio mori were rising step by step to
higher rank and power, when the abdication of Toba no,
1123, and the question as to his successor, threw everything
into confusion. His immediate successor was his son Sho
toku, in 1124, who after reigning seventeen years retired
(mainly on account of the intrigues of his stepmother) at
the age of thirty-nine. He left a son, Sighe shto, but was
succeeded by his half-brother, Kon ye no in, who, after
reigning fourteen years, died at the age of seventeen. The
latter had been elevated to the throne by the intrigues of Bi
fouk mon, his mother, and she suspected the late Emperor
of having caused his death in order that his own son Sighe
shto might ascend the throne. But in order to defeat these
projects, she induced her son on his deathbed to adopt his
half-brother Go ziro kawa. A younger son was thus in
actual possession, while his nephew and the eldest son of the
elder brother were displaced. The lineal heir endeavored to
regain his rights. He raised an army, and on his side were
ranged as leaders many of the higher members of the Minnamoto
family. On the other side was Kio mori, of the
Taira family, and, of the Minnamoto family, Yoshi tomo
and Tada mitsi. A battle was fought only eleven days after
the death of the old Emperor Toba no in. Notwithstanding
the bravery and prowess of the leaders of their opponents,
the He ji, the party in power, gained the day. Among the
leaders of the Gen ji was Tame tomo, famous for his power
in drawing a bow (owing, perhaps, to the one arm being
shorter than the other), and, in his subsequent life, as a rover
over the Southern seas. He was the first historical occupier
of the islands to the south of Japan, Hatchi jo and its chain,
linked on to the southeastern promontory, and the Liookioo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
Islands, with the chain joined by links to the southwestern
promontory of the mainland. He was the brother of Yoshi
tomo, who fought on the opposite side. As a reward for
their success on behalf of the Emperor <i>de facto</i>, Go ziro
kawa, Minnamoto Yoshi tomo and Taira Kio mori were both
raised to higher rank and power, and to each was given a
province as a more substantial acknowledgment of their
assistance. From this time mutual jealousy seems to have
grown up between these two. But the ability of the reigning
Emperor, who thenceforward took the reins into his own
hands, seems to have kept down their smoldering jealousy.
As to the prince who was endeavoring to resume his lawful
rights, he and his father, the Emperor Sho toku, were banished
to the province of Sanuki, where the latter died in the
year 1163. He died of starvation, having written a letter to
the Emperor with his blood, upon a piece of his shirt; but
Kio mori would not let the Emperor see it.</p>

<p>The banished Emperor Sho toku was devoted to his worship,
and since his death he has to many worshipers taken
the place of Compera. This is a name much worshiped
in Japan as a god. As a hideous idol with a long nose he
has temples erected to his worship in every village. Immediately
after the death of Sho toku, in 1163, a violent storm
or earthquake took place, and as he was known to have a
great reverence for Compera, this convulsion of nature was
attributed to the anger of this supposed being, and a magnificent
temple was raised by his son and grandson on Dzo
dzu Hill (Elephant’s Head Hill), at Matzuyama, near Marungame,
in the province of Sanuki. Sho toku (known by
the adopted name of Seengeen) is by many looked upon as
Compera gongen. Compera, from the Chinese characters
composing the name, seems to be Kapila, of Indian mythology.
Kapila was known as the founder of the Sankya
school of philosophy in India, which, in reference to the
sacred Vedas, held the authority of revelations as paramount
to reason and experience, to which Buddha, either for his
philosophical or his moral or religious doctrines, would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
submit. Some have thought Kapila and Buddha to be the
same person. His anniversary day is the tenth day of the
tenth month. He is revered for his great strength, which
he exerted in favor of Sakya mooni. In Buddhist history,
Daibadatta wished to destroy Say son—<i>i.e.</i>, Sakya mooni.
He took up a large stone, twenty-four yards long and four-arms’
length broad, and threw it down on him. Compera
saw the action, and instantly stretched out his hand and
caught the stone as it fell. Another name of Compera is
He-ira. He is called also Kapira, and “Goo pira,” and
“Goo he ira.” The name of Ee ngio wo—power equal to
emperor—is also given to him for his strength. Fudowo mio
is, according to some, the same as Compera. Many persons
worship him because his name begins with “gold.”</p>

<p>Kio mori turned out to be the ablest and most unscrupulous
minister of the time, but the Emperor, who had abdicated,
still took the principal management of affairs during
the reigns of his son and two grandsons. Kio mori at the
age of fifty-one shaved his head, and nominally retired into
priest’s orders in 1169.</p>

<p>Yoshi tomo in 1159 had conspired to destroy Kio mori.
He failed, and was killed while in the bath by his own servant,
Osada. His eldest son went to Miako with the view
of killing Kio mori, but was discovered and put to death.
His second son died. His third son, Yoritomo, born 1147,
fled with his mother (Tokiwa go zen, a woman of low origin)
and two brothers. Overtaken by snow and hunger, they
were arrested and brought back, when Kio mori forced her
to become his concubine. His friends demanded that the
children should be put to death, but, at the intercession of
his own aunt, he saved their lives, but banished Yoritomo
to Hiruga ko jima, or one of the islands to the south of Idzu.
The other two boys, Yoshitzune and Nori yori, were kept
in Miako and educated for priests. The former of them was
afterward a well-known hero. His nickname when a boy
was Ushi waka, or young ox or calf. Yoritomo, while a boy,
was known as Sama no kami, or captain of the left cavalry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>At this time, 1170, Tame tomo above mentioned, who had
been roving about the South Sea for years past, landed on
the mountainous province and peninsula of Idzu, and attempted
to raise a rebellion; but his men were overcome,
and he himself committed suicide. A temple was raised to
his memory, and he is worshiped both in Hatchi jo and in
the Liookioo Islands.</p>

<p>In 1171 the Emperor Taka kura no in, at the age of eleven
years, married the daughter of Kio mori, aged fifteen years.
This rendered Kio mori still more powerful, and at the same
time more imperious in his conduct. He emerged from his
seclusion, and placed his two sons in the office of Tai sho or
first generals, over the heads of others who had hoped for
the places. This raised a community of feeling against him,
and again a conspiracy was made to attack and kill him and
the whole of his family, but it failed through the treachery of
some of the conspirators. The Empress, Kio mori’s daughter,
1178, had a son, and in the following year his own son,
Sighe mori, died. This son had proved some obstacle to the
working out of his father’s schemes of ambition, and when
he was removed by death Kio mori imperiously ruled according
to his own pleasure. His grandson, Antoku, in 1181,
became Emperor. Kio mori became very tyrannical before
his death; he not only kept the old Emperor confined, but
tried to change the residence of the court from Miako to Fu
ku wara, and determined to extirpate the family of Minnamoto.
Once more a conspiracy was set on foot to destroy
the family of He, by one of the royal princes, who had suffered
from the arrogant insolence of Kio mori. Letters were
obtained from the old Emperor and secretly dispatched to
Yoritomo, then in banishment on the coast of Idzu, who
was looked upon as the head of the Minnamoto family
and the chief enemy of Kio mori and the He kay. His
brother Yoshitzune had escaped from Miako, in the retinue
of some gold merchants, to the province of Dewa, and was
residing in that province with Hide hira, Mootz no kami.
Yoritomo had married the daughter of Hojio Toki massa, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
whose charge he was during his banishment. Through her
father she was descended from Kwan mu, Emperor, and was
afterward known as Ama Shiogoon, or female Shiogoon, her
name being Taira no Massa go. When the letters were given
to him from the Emperor and his son, calling upon him to
raise troops to rid the country of Kio mori, and release them
from the durance in which they were kept, he immediately
wrote to his brother Yoshitzune, calling upon him to assist
him. Under such surveillance were these royal parties kept
that it was only under the guise of paying a visit to the great
temple of Miajima, on the beautiful island Itsuku jima, in
the inland sea, in the province of Aki, then belonging to
Kio mori, that the conspirators were able to get the letters
dispatched. Yoritomo, with Hojio, collected what men he
could, and raised the flag at Ishi bashi yama. When he first
started only seven men joined him, and he fought his first
battle with only three hundred under him, against ten times
their number. He was defeated, and with his seven friends
ran away, and the story goes that they all hid in the hollow
trunk of a large tree near Ishi bashi hatto. While remaining
concealed there, the soldiers, having examined every
other place, came to the conclusion they must be there. A
Kashiwara man (secretly a partisan of the Gen party) volunteered
to go and look, and, though suspected, he was
allowed to do so. He went up, looked in, and saw the party
hiding, and told them to lie still, and taking his spear showed
his commander that he could turn it all round the hollow.
When he did so, two bats or birds flew out, and he told his
commander that the mouth of the hollow was covered over
with spiders’ webs. The party of soldiers went away.
Yoritomo and his friends left immediately, and went to a
temple, where they were secreted in the wardrobe for storing
the dresses of the priests. Meantime the soldiers returned,
looked into the tree, and found that they had been there.
They then went to the temple, demanded of the priest where
they were secreted, and, on his refusing to tell, they killed
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>Meanwhile Yoshitzune collected what forces he could,
and with them went down to Kamakura, at the head of the
Odawara division of the Bay of Yedo.</p>

<p>Yoritomo was forced to take refuge in the remote peninsula
of Awa, southeast of Yedo, whence he dispatched missives
calling on all the Gen family to collect, sending Hojio, his
father-in-law, to the province of Kahi, and joining Hiro
tsune with a large body of men on the banks of the river
Sumida gawa, that division of the Tonay gawa which runs
past the eastern side of Yedo. In the province of Musasi he
was joined by Hatake yama; while his relation, Yoshi naka
of Kisso, raised an army in Sinano. Yoritomo fixed upon
Kamakura, in the province of Segami, at a very early date,
for his residence. This beautiful classic spot is within two
hours’ ride of Yokohama, and shows now little trace of having
once been the residence of a court. Trivial circumstances
probably led him to this conclusion, as it does not seem to be
a place suited in any way for a large city or for the capital
of a country. He was a man of great ability, and of strong
will, but had received no education; and having been brought
up in the province of Idzu, had acquired the dialect of the
district. The mountain-pass of Hakkone is considered the
key to the eastern provinces, and if it were sufficiently
guarded, his position would be one of comparative safety,
at a distance of a day’s march from the pass. His relation,
Yori Yoshi, had formerly resided there, and he had
probably looked upon it, when a boy, as the family property.
From his residence here he was called, by the people of
Kwanto, Kam kura dono, a name by which he is spoken
of to this day. Kwanto literally means east of the barrier—<i>i.e.</i>,
of Hakkone—and is synonymous with Ban do, east of
the hill. It is a name by which are understood all the eight
provinces to the east of the range of hills running down the
promontory of Idzu; viz., Segami, Musasi, Simotsuki, Kowotsuki,
Simosa, Kadsusa, Awa, and Fitatsi. It is called
also Kwang hasshiu.</p>

<p>Forces were sent from Miako by Kio mori to oppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
Yoritomo, but at this time his relative Hojio met him with
a large re-enforcement, and the He party retired without
fighting. Yoritomo overran the province of Fitatsi and put
to death Satake Hide Yoshi. The whole empire was now
desolated by war. The tide began, before Kio mori died, at
the age of sixty-four, in 1181, to turn in favor of the Gen
party. But so long as Kio mori lived the cause of his opponents
did not seem to hold out much prospect of success, and
the relatives of Yoritomo are still found fighting against him,
and on the side of the ruling party. Among these were his
own uncle Yoshi hiro, and Yoshi naka, another relative.
The latter was afterward reconciled to Yoritomo, and rendered
him great assistance, being everywhere victorious in
the northern provinces of Etsjiu and Kanga. Thence he
rapidly pushed on to the capital, and seized the extensive
monastery of Hiyaysan. The Emperor Antoku fled westward
with his wife, Kio mori’s daughter. His grandfather,
the old Emperor Go Zirakawa, received his deliverers in
Miako, and still retaining his interest in the regulation of
affairs, saw another grandson, brother of Antoku, proclaimed
as Emperor. The possessions of the He party were confiscated
and divided among the members of the Gen family.
Antoku remained about Da zai foo, the station from which
military superintendence of the island of Kiusiu was regulated,
but from this island the He party was driven out and
crossed over to Sikok. Still they were able in different parts
of the country to make a stand, and even to defeat their
adversaries in more than one battle. Several of the party
had been left in Miako in posts of consequence, the son of
Kio mori being regent, and they did what they could to support
their cause in the capital. Yoshi naka, who had seized
Miako on the part of the Genji, became in his turn overbearing,
and roused the impatience of the old Emperor, who
stirred up the priests of the monasteries of Hiyaysan and
Midera to oppose him. But Yoshi naka suddenly came upon
them, seized and imprisoned the Emperor, and beheaded the
abbots of the religious houses. He caused himself to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
created Sei dai Shiogoon, and finally set himself up in opposition
to Yoritomo. Yoshitzune and Nori Yori, brothers of
Yoritomo, were immediately dispatched from the Kwanto
to Miako to attack him, and set free the Emperor and his
grandfather, and he was defeated by them and killed.
Meantime, 1184, the He ji had been gathering their strength
in the western provinces, and had assembled an army of
100,000 men and fortified themselves. Nori Yori and Yoshitzune
attacked them, and after a very severe engagement
took the fort by assault and completely routed the army,
killing many of the leaders of the party. After this Yoritomo
ordered his son-in-law, son of Yoshi naka, to be put to
death, and Yoshitzune was appointed governor of Miako.
He attacked the enemy in the island of Sikok, and also in
the western provinces of Nagato, and at the fort of Aka
Magaseki routed them; the mother of the Emperor escaping
with the two insignia of rule—the sacred sword and the seal
or ball. But in crossing over from Simonoseki the Emperor
threw himself into the sea and was drowned. Of the two
sacred emblems, the sword was said to have been lost; the
seal was saved. At this narrowest part of the passage between
Kiusiu and Nippon runs a ledge of rocks, and upon
these stands a small column, or tombstone, to the memory
of the Emperor. On the Kiusiu side is the village of Dairi,
called so from the imperial family having rested there.
Moone mori, one of the party, is said to have fled to the
island of Tsussima, where his descendants to this day rule
as (the Chinese sound of the name) Sso. When the men of
the party were all destroyed, the females crowded the port
of Simonoseki, and were obliged to live by prostitution; and
hence the females of this class in Simonoseki are accorded to
this day the first rank of the class, and privileges—in the
way of dress, such as wearing stockings, and wearing the
knot of the obi or belt behind, like other women, and not
before, as prostitutes—which are denied to others. In the
center of the island of Kiusiu, between Fiuga and Higo, is
a high tableland, partly marsh, extending from twenty to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
thirty miles in length. According to native accounts, this
place was, a hundred years ago, quite a <i>terra incognita</i>.
About that time it was discovered that there were people
living in three villages within the marsh. The principal
village was called Mayra. Further investigation being
made, it was discovered that these were remnants of the He
ji, who had fled there at this period, and had isolated themselves
through fear. They had conveyed their fears to their
children, who, when visited, had a dread of being punished
for the crimes of their forefathers. The three villages are
now under charge of a Hattamoto.</p>

<p>The power of the He family was thus completely broken,
and that of the Gen or Minnamoto firmly established, mainly
through the prowess and generalship of Yoshitzune. Yoritomo
began to be jealous of his brother on account of the
credit and reputation he had gained by his success. He
picked a quarrel with him on the ground of his having married
a daughter of the enemy of the house, Kio mori, and
sent forces against him, demanding of the Emperor that his
father-in-law, Hojio, should be appointed generalissimo, by
this means filling the places of command with his own creatures.
Yoshitzune left the capital and retired to Oshiu to his
old friend Hide Hira, governor of the province. Yoritomo
was enraged at an asylum being given to his brother in the
north, and sent orders to have him put to death. Yasu hira,
the son of his old friend, attacked him, and Yoshitzune, being
unprepared and seeing no way of escape, destroyed himself,
after first killing his wife and children. Yoritomo,
angry with the man for doing what he himself had ordered,
marched against Yasu hira with a large army, and finally
destroyed him. Yoritomo built a palace for himself in Miako,
but appears generally to have lived at Kamakura. At this
latter place are to be seen to this day the remains of his work
in the roads cut through rocks which confined the space of
ground set apart for his residence.</p>

<p>In 1190 he went to Miako, where he had built a palace,
and in great state visited the Emperor; but after a month’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
residence in the capital he returned to Kamakura. In 1192
the old Emperor Go zira kawa died at the age of sixty-seven.
He had lived, after his abdication, during parts of the reigns
of five emperors, his sons and grandsons. He had during
forty years taken a very active part in the working of the
government, and had passed through the most exciting time
in the history of his country. His last years were spent in
tranquillity.</p>

<p>Yoritomo was appointed Sei dai Shiogoon. Suspecting
his brother Nori Yori of plotting against him, he banished
him to Idzu, where he was soon after put to death. He
again visited the capital for four months in 1195, but returned
to Kamakura, from which place he virtually ruled
the empire. He fell from his horse toward the end of 1198,
and died shortly after, in 1199, at the age of fifty-three. He
is generally regarded as the greatest hero in Japanese history.
But his treatment of his brother has been a great blot
upon his character, and lowered him very much in the regard
of his countrymen. Yoshitzune is looked upon as the mirror
of chivalry, and his conduct is held up to the youth of the
country for imitation, rather than the calculating, bloody,
though brilliant career of Yoritomo.</p>

<p>Kamakura seems to have occupied under Yoritomo very
nearly the same situation, in a political point of view, that
Yedo does in the present day. The absence of external foes
having created a necessity for internal division, two courts
arose, the one with forms without power, the other wielding
all the power and dispensing with the forms, except when it
suited him to demand them. Yoritomo seems to have been
the first to establish his court in the eastern part of the empire,
a retreat which he chose probably on account of its retired
and defensible situation. Standing upon the sea, the
place is inclosed by hills, and in order to obtain access to the
town a road was cut on either side through the hills. That
to the east, toward Kanesawa, is a fine perpendicular cutting
through sandstone. The houses occupied by Yoritomo, and
after him by Ashikanga, or the sites where they stood, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
pointed out. Here stands a fine temple to Hatchimang,
erected since the days of Yoritomo, and upon the spot where
his son was assassinated. It is known as Suruga oka Hatchimang.
An avenue with three fine stone archways leads
straight to the sea from the door of the temple. Upon the
platform on which the temple stands is a small shrine to
Inari, the god of rice, worshiped everywhere in Japan; another
to the spirit of Yoritomo; another to stones in which
some divine power is supposed to reside. Two stones below
show that the Phallic worship lingers in Japan, female (so
to speak) as well as male, while a temple on the shore, near
Ooraga, is entirely devoted to this infatuation. The tomb
of Yoritomo, an unpretending slab, is in the neighborhood.
A small hill opposite has the name of Kinoo hari yama, taking
this name from Yoritomo having ordered it to be covered
with white silk to show some of his lady friends how it
looked in winter. The story may be doubted, if it were only
on account of the scarcity of silk at that time. At Kanesawa
are the tombs of the servants of Yoshitzune. About half a
mile from the temple of Hatchimang, on the road to Fusisawa,
is the fine old temple called Kenchoji, built by order
of Moone taka Sinwo, son of the Emperor Sanga. Further
on is a nunnery or convent for ladies, the Matzunga oka.
Looking toward the sea, the little island or peninsula of
Eeno sima is visible. On the road in this direction is a temple
built by a daughter of Mito; a little beyond is a place
famous for the manufacture of swords; and beyond this is a
village with a temple to Kunon, the goddess of mercy (Kwan
yin of China).</p>

<p>Turning to the right from the village is a large copper
figure of Buddha sitting in the open air, in a position and
with an air of great repose. It is between forty and fifty
feet high. Around this colossal figure are seen in the grass
large flat stones. These are the bases of the pillars of a
temple which once covered the figure. But during a severe
earthquake a rush of the sea over a temporary subsidence of
the land swept away everything but the massive figure and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
foundation-stones of the temple. It looks at present far out
of reach of the renewal of any such devastation.</p>

<p>The glory of Kamakura has removed to Yedo, and what
is said by the Jesuit fathers to have been at one time a town
of 200,000 houses is now a village of not 200 cottages.</p>

<p>The son of Yoritomo, Yori ye, succeeded him in all his
employments; but proving unequal to the task of governing,
he retired, and his son, Sanne tomo, at twelve years of age,
was appointed Sei dai Shiogoon, Tokimasa, father-in-law of
Yoritomo, being regent; and from this date the power of the
Hojio family began. The following year they put to death
Yori ye. Tokimasa assassinated Hatake yama, and afterward
had designs upon Sanne tomo’s life at the instigation
of his wife; but they were discovered by Sanne tomo’s grandmother,
Yoritomo’s widow, and Tokimasa was banished.
Sanne tomo was assassinated by his brother Kokio (who had
become a priest, and officiated in the temple) while descending
the stairs of the large temple of Hatchimang goo, at
Kamakura, after worshiping there at night. He was the
last Shiogoon of the family of Yoritomo. The power fell to
the hands of Hojio no Yoshi toki, who ruled with Masa go,
widow of Yoritomo, known as “Ama shiogoon,” or the Nun
commander-in-chief. Hojio Yasu toki was Sikken, a title
which was afterward changed to Kwan rei, or minister to
the Shiogoon at Kamakura, and began to assume a similar
position toward the Shiogoon that the latter held toward the
Emperor. Hojio and Hasago raised to the office of Shiogoon
Yoritsone, son of Fusiwara no Mitsi ye. Yoritsone resigned
the post of Shiogoon at the age of twenty-seven to his son,
aged six, who the following year married a daughter of
Hojio. The father and son, being in 1251 discovered to be
concerned in a plot against the Emperor, were seized; and
the office was now given to one of the royal family from
Minko, Moone taka, “Sin wo.” In his time Hojio Toki yori,
then Kwanrei, built the large temple of Kenchoji at Kamakura.
The Hojio family (Fosio of Klaproth) at this time
absorbed the chief authority in the empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>The historical notes which follow are taken from a native
almanac with the assistance of a native, and are in themselves
uninteresting; but they give some short notice of the
wars between the Emperors of the North and South, of the
rise to power of different families—such as Hojio, Ashikanga,
Nitta, Hossokawa, and others—who occupied prominent
places in Japanese history down to the time of Nobu nanga,
when a military genius arose to extract order out of confusion,
and system out of a chaos of anarchy. But even the
confused and uninteresting mass of names entangled in facts
may give an impression of what the state of the country was
during a period when nothing but turmoil and boiling brought
one after another to the surface, to make way in turn for others
from the abyss below. That some information is contained
in these notes, may be an excuse for placing them
here in such a meager and unentertaining form. But the
names of individuals, of places, of temples, become interesting
as more is known of the history of the country and the
religion of Japan.</p>

<p>In 1260 the Nitsi ren sect of Buddhists was introduced
at Kamakura, a sect which has become of more prominence
lately, since foreigners arrived in Japan, owing to a saint
of the sect, Saysho gosama, having been a great persecutor
of Christians.</p>

<p>Hojio Toki yori, minister of the Shiogoon, one of the great
men of Japan, died in 1263, aged thirty-seven; and the Shiogoon
Moone taka was forced to resign, and his son, Kore
Yassu, a child, raised to the office.</p>

<p>In China, the Mokoo (or Mongol), about 1276, had overthrown
the Sung dynasty. Corea was compelled to become
tributary, and embassies from China were sent to Japan,
calling upon the Emperor to send his tribute. At different
times several large naval expeditions were fitted out by the
Chinese emperor, the Kublai of Marco Polo. One of these,
in 1281, reached the coast of Tsussima; but in consequence
of severe storms, said to have been raised by the opportune
assistance of the god at Isse (whence he is called Kase mo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
mia, or god of the wind), the vessels were knocked to pieces,
and 30,000 men taken prisoners and killed. One of the embassadors
was beheaded at Kamakura. The power of the
Hojio family had become so great at Kamakura that they
retained in their own hands the appointment of Emperor.</p>

<p>In 1282, the Sikken, or Kwanrei, died, and was succeeded
by his son, aged fourteen years; so that at this time it would
appear that the country was governed by a deputy or assistant
of a boy, the deputy or minister of the commander-in-chief
under the reigning Emperor, with the advice and assistance
of one, and perhaps two, abdicated Emperors.</p>

<p>This state of things could not be expected to continue,
and could only exist in a country with no external relations
and with no neighbors. The divided government made up
to some extent for this want, but it left so many opportunities
for individuals plotting to seize the power that it is no
wonder that the Emperors and the Shiogoons chafed under
it. This was met by a constant accession to these high posts
of children, who, when they began to be troublesome, were
forced to resign, the Hojio family continuing to hold the real
power at Kamakura and Miako, and also in Kiusiu, and deposing
the Emperors and Shiogoons when they pleased, and
electing whomsoever suited them.</p>

<p>So early as 1284 the laws of the country seem to have
followed a policy of exclusion. In that year an officer came
over from China in the quality of embassador, accompanied
by a priest, but he was taken and executed on the pretext
that he was come to spy out the land. Some years after,
another priest, Na yissang, came from China, and he also
was treated at Kamakura as a spy, and imprisoned, but was
afterward liberated, and built the temple of Nan jenji, still
standing in Miako.</p>

<p>In 1308, Hana zo no, then twelve years of age, was
chosen by the officers of the Hojio family at Kamakura
as Emperor.</p>

<p>In 1312 the Kwanrei Hojio Sada toki died, much respected,
and the place of minister was kept for his son, Sada toki, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
five years by two relations, till he was fourteen years of age,
when he became Kwanrei.</p>

<p>The executive at Kamakura had named Godaigo as successor
to the Emperor, and he came to the throne when he
was thirty-one years of age. He very soon began to be irritated
with the position he held, ruled over by subordinates
at Kamakura. He married the daughter of Chiooso Kane
Kado, a high officer of Chinese extraction.</p>

<p>In 1321 the office known as the Ki rokusho was established
in the palace at Miako.</p>

<p>Taka toki, the young Kwanrei, was very dissipated, passing
his time between wine and women, and in consequence
was hated; and in 1325 Yori Kazoo and Kooni nanga, by
secret orders from the Emperor, set out on an attempt to
take his life; but he was previously informed of it, and seized
them, and put them to death. Taka toki being ill, shaved
his head and took orders when he was twenty-four years of
age, and his relative, Taka Ske, at Nagasaki, assumed the
chief power. The arrogance of the Hojio family at Kamakura
excited intense ill-will at Miako, and the attempt to
overthrow this power gave rise to the troubles known as the
war between the North and South Emperors, which desolated
Japan for many years, and which ended in the downfall of
both the Emperor and the Hojio faction.</p>

<p>In 1327, Oto no mia, one of the Emperor’s sons, determined
to break down the power of the Hojio family at
Kamakura; but his intrigues were divulged, and he was
compelled to shave his head and become a priest, as
Tendai no Zass, or head of the Buddhists. But this did
not prevent him putting on his armor again when occasion
offered. He afterward, under the name of Mori
Yoshi, was Shiogoon.</p>

<p>1330. The Emperor still longed to destroy the influence
of the Hojio party. He consulted with the Buddhist priests,
then a very powerful body in the realm. He built the fortress
of Kassangi in Yamato, to be seen to this day; but his
design was discovered, and he was obliged to fly to this fort,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
whence he sent for Koosinoki massa Singhi, then a small
officer in Kawadsi, but considered a very able soldier.</p>

<p>In 1331 the forces of Taka toki attacked and took the
castle of Kassangi, and taking Godaigo prisoner, sent him
to the island of Oki, and for some years there was no Emperor.
Ko gen was called “Tenwo” by the Kamakura party,
but he was called the False Emperor by his opponents.</p>

<p>In 1332, Otonomia, Nitta, and Koosinoki met at Chi wa
ya, a castle near Miako. While the Kamakura army of
Hojio overcame the other detachments, they were repulsed
by that under Koosinoki. Nitta Yoshi assembled an army
in the province of Kowotski. Troops were sent against him
from Kamakura, but after several engagements he marched
upon and sacked and burned that town. Among the officers
of the Hojio party some were killed in battle, others were
beheaded, and many killed themselves. Among the last
was Taka toki. His son had his throat cut. In Kiusiu the
Hojio party was defeated by Owotomo, who seized the governor,
whose life was saved, but all the other members of
the Hojio family, who had been so overbearing during their
period of rule, were massacred by the people. Their authority,
which had been paramount for years in Kamakura, and
thence in the empire, was completely broken down.</p>

<p>Godaigo was restored to the throne. He had not improved
by adversity, and was weak in his character. He
removed all the officers in place, and, against the advice of
his friends and ministers, conferred rank and power on Ashikanga
Taka ooji, who had entered into a conspiracy against
him, and who afterward became the most powerful man in
the empire and founder of a long line of Shiogoons. The
Emperor gave to those who had assisted him large landed
possessions: to Ashikanga, the provinces of Hitatsi, Musasi,
and Simosa; to Nitta Yoshi Sada, Kowotski and Harima;
and to his son, Etsingo; to Koosinoki, Setsu and Kawadsi;
and to others in proportion. Mori Yosi, the royal priest, had
been appointed Shiogoon, but at the instance of Ashikanga
was imprisoned and deposed. The Emperor had been warned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
against Ashikanga by Madenga koji chika foossa, his minister,
in vain. This minister was the author, in 1341, of the
“Shoku gen sho,” the red book of the court of Miako.</p>

<p>The war which was now commencing is known as the
war between the Northern and Southern Emperors—the
Hokko cho and the Nancho. Each party set up one Emperor
after another, while the war raged under generals who
were fighting for the office of commander-in-chief rather than
for the empire. Ashikanga and Nitta, Koosinoki and Hossokawa,
Kikootchi and Owotomo, were the prominent leaders;
while Godaigo, as Emperor of the South, was succeeded by
Go mura Kami, retaining possession of, during a series of
misfortunes, the three insignia of imperial power. On the
other hand, Ko gen, called False Emperor, was succeeded
as Emperor of the North by his brother Komio, who abdicated
in favor of Sh’ko, who was taken prisoner, and Ko
ngong took his place; but he and both his predecessors fell
into the hands of their opponent. After the destruction of
Kamakura and the downfall of the Hojio family in 1332, the
theater of war changed to the neighborhood of Miako. Yoshi
mitz, afterward the great Ashikanga, was appointed Shiogoon
in 1367, when he was ten years of age. On both sides
treachery on the part of the generals seems to have been a
trivial and common occurrence; and this is not surprising,
inasmuch as there was no principle involved, and no party-cry
to rally under. Each general was fighting for himself
and for his own advancement, while the opposing Emperors
looked on apparently without much feeling or interest in the
question at issue. By this war in the island of Kiusiu the
family of Satsuma largely increased its power and possessions
at the expense of Kikootchi.</p>

<p>In the year 1392, by the mediation of O-ooji, lord of the
provinces in the west part of Nippon, peace was brought
about. He induced the Emperor of the South to bring to
Miako the three emblems, and to give them up to his rival,
accepting the title of Dai jio ten wo. Thenceforward both
Emperors lived in Miako, Go ko matz reigning. During the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
first troublous times Ashikanga had been strengthening his
position, enriching himself and rising in rank and favor to
the highest position to which a subject could attain. He built
a splendid house for himself in Muro Matchi Street, called
the Palace of Flowers, and two others called respectively the
Gold and Silver Houses, which were large enough to be
taken away in pieces (after his death) and form parts of different
temples, of which these parts are still looked upon as
the chief ornaments. Such is the temple of Tchikuboo shima
in the Great Lake. The titles given him were the head of
the Gen family: Joone san goo—<i>i.e.</i>, as the Emperor’s second
son—and Dai Shiogoon. He was at length, before he
was forty, raised to be Dai jo dai jin, and during the following
year he gave up his titles and place, and, shaving his
head, retired under the Buddhist name of Zensan, or Heavenly
Mountain. He moved about with a style and equipage
similar to that used by the Emperor. He sent an embassy
to China, and received an answer, in which he was styled
Nippon wo or King of Japan. The Emperor visited him,
and conferred on him the title of Kubosama—Kubo being
the title of the father or predecessor of the Emperor after
abdication, sama implying that he is equal to or “the same
as.” He was the first to whom the title was given, and it
is still a title which is conferred by the Emperor, and is not
inherent in any office. He died in 1408. The office of Shiogoon
became hereditary in the family of Ashikanga, and
henceforth the position of Kwanrei or Minister to the Shiogoon
was aspired to as conveying the chief power in the
empire. Kamakura was still the usual residence of this
officer. Eight families were set apart, from among whom
it was eligible to name the Kwanrei, chief among whom
were Hossokawa, Hatake yama, and Ooyay soongi—the
family of Hossokawa being at this time the most powerful.
After the death of the great Ashikanga, his descendants were
unable to wield the power which he had transmitted to them.
He does not seem to have established any powerful government
throughout the empire, but would appear to have held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
what he had seized rather from the country being tired of
civil war than from any great administrative talent in himself.
During the century which followed, civil war seems
to have been the normal state of Japan—one man after another
rising to seize the reins—at one time at Miako, at
another at Kamakura. No one chief was able to reduce
the whole empire to a settled state of tranquillity. If one
rose a little above his compeers, they combined against
him; while the monasteries and religious sects were so
powerful as to be able to insure success to whatever side
they gave their influence and assistance. This state of
things continued till Nobu nanga gradually rose out of
the crowd, and struck down the power of these Buddhist
sects.</p>

<p>1410. While the appointment of a Dai or great Shiogoon
was kept up at Miako, an inferior officer, with the title of
Shiogoon only, was placed in Kamakura, with a minister
under him. The men who filled both offices were still of the
Ashikanga family. When so many high offices were held
by powerful chiefs, jealousy was excited, and this kept up
a state of constant civil war in some parts of the country.
The three rich provinces of Bizen, Mimesaka, and Harima
were taken from the owner, Akamatz, who to revenge himself
invited the Dai Shiogoon to a banquet and assassinated
him. He in turn committed suicide, and his territory was
divided.</p>

<p>In 1414 the three emblems were stolen, but were afterward
recovered. The family of Hossokawa was rising to
power and wealth at Kamakura, while that of Ashikanga
was on the wane.</p>

<p>In 1415, for the first time, an act was passed by the ruling
powers known as a Tokusayay. This is a law suddenly
passed, by which all mercantile engagements are at an end
and all debts cancelled. This act of arbitrary, high-handed
injustice has been carried out over and over again in Japan,
and is generally the act of some high officer who has borrowed
money largely. Whether it was carried to the full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
extent stated may be doubted, but it has been the cause of
much trouble and anxiety.</p>

<p>In 1462 Ashikanga nari ooji, son of the former Shiogoon
of Kamakura, was obliged to fly to Ko nga in the province
of Simotsuki.</p>

<p>In 1466 the war known in history as the “Onin” commenced,
and lasted during the following eleven years. The
dispute arose between two sons of the chief Shibba, in which
the late Shiogoon and his successor took opposite sides. This
was the breeze which fanned the smoldering flame arising in
the desire on the part of the wife of the abdicated Shiogoon
that her son should be nominated to succeed, otherwise he
would be compelled to shave his head and become a priest.
The whole country around Miako was desolated by war and
slaughter, great excesses being committed, during which
houses, temples, libraries, and documents of value were
destroyed, and, as might have been expected, a famine occurred
in 1472. This, together with the death of the generals
commanding on both sides—Yamana Sozeng and Hossokawa—led
to a cessation of hostilities in 1474, when some
years of quiet and peace followed.</p>

<p>1487. The famous Ota do Kwang was assassinated by
Sadamasa. An anecdote related of him is often taken as a
subject by Japanese artists. He was out hawking when
a heavy rain came on. Seeing a little cottage, he with his
attendants went to ask for a grass rain-coat. A beautiful
young woman came out, and upon his asking for what he
wanted, she went to the garden, pulled a branch of a flower,
and kneeling down presented it to the gentleman. Looking
at the plant, he at once perceived that she was modestly
making a play upon the word rain-coat, the plant being
known by the name of “no seed,” which implied also by a
turn of words that she had no rain-coat to give him.</p>

<p>1487. War again broke out between the Shiogoon and
Sasaki in the province of Oomi, which lasted for three or
four years, when the Shiogoon fled to the territories of
O-ooji, then chief of the western provinces of Nippon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>About 1494 the family of Hojio of Odawara took its rise
in the person of Zinkio, who had been a merchant in Isse,
but whose genius seems to have been military, and who was
known afterward as Hojio so woon. He seized whatever
territory in the Kwanto and around the castle of Odawara
he could lay his hands upon. During these periods this unfortunate
country was not only desolated by civil war and
all its horrors, but it suffered severely in addition from convulsions
of nature. In 1472 a famine arose as the concomitant
of war. In 1475 a very extensive earthquake occurred
on the sixth day of the eighth month, when a wave from the
sea, during a temporary subsidence of the earth, carried
away at one sweep a large part of the lower quarter of the
city of Osaka. In 1496 there was a drought all over the empire,
which was followed by a famine in 1497. And the next
year was marked by severe earthquakes all over Japan;
while in 1506 all the old fir-trees on the hill Kassunga yama
near Narra died to the number of above 7,000. A similar
disease had visited Japan in 1406, exactly a hundred years
before. Severe drought and dreadful thunderstorms in 1514
were followed in 1515 by earthquakes over the whole country.</p>

<p>The new century brought no cessation from war and
assassination. Hossokawa, then prime minister, was assassinated
by his servant Kassai. O-ooji, from the western
provinces, marched upon Miako, bringing his protégé, the
late Shiogoon, with him, and, seizing the capital, caused the
Emperor to install him as prime minister or Kwanrei, an
office which had for many years been in the hold of the three
families, Shibba, Hossokawa, and Hatake yama. An attempt
was made in Miako to assassinate the Shiogoon during
the night, but he killed the assassins with his own sword.</p>

<p>In 1510 Nangao, a servant, and relative of Ooyay Soongi,
minister at Kamakura, rebelled against his master, defeated
him, and entered into possession of his castle and territory
in the province of Etsingo, where he afterward became very
powerful as Ooyay Soongi Kengshing. Hossokawa and
O-ooji drove one another alternately out of Miako, but ultimately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
the latter retired to his own western province of
Suwo; and during the same time Hojio of Odawara was
fighting in the Kwanto with Miura.</p>

<p>1486. Hossokawa massa moto was made Kwanrei.</p>

<p>In 1521, for the first time in many years, the Emperor
made a public appearance. The officers and court were both
impoverished. The land was barely and sparsely cultivated.
The young were growing up in perfect ignorance. Hossokawa
brought Yoshi haru to Miako, and made him Shiogoon,
and put the Shiogoon, Yoshitanne, into confinement in the
island of Awadsi. The following year the latter died in
the province of Awa, where his descendants still live, and
the head of the family is still known as “Awa kubo.”</p>

<p>In the year 1523 an attempt was made to commence a
trade with China at Ningpo. O-ooji, the lord of the western
provinces, sent over ships. But at this time the coasts of
China were infested by Japanese pirates, and the attempt
to trade does not seem to have been successful: it shows,
however, that a commerce was beginning before the Portuguese
visited Japan.</p>

<p>1528. Mioshi kaï woong, from the province of Awa in
Sikok, attacked Miako; the Kwanrei, Takakooni, on the
part of the Shiogoon, met him at the Katsura gawa, the
river running into the sea at Osaka, but was defeated, and
the Shiogoon fled to Oomi, where the head of the Sasaki
family gave him shelter.</p>

<p>1530. The following year the Kwanrei and Mioshi were
again at war in the neighborhood of Osaka, when the former
was defeated, taken prisoner, and put to death.</p>

<p>1532. Haru moto, whom Mioshi had placed as Kwanrei
in Miako, took offense at some of the proceedings of the
latter, and ordered him to be killed.</p>

<p>1536. At this period the Emperor was very poor and his
expenses were defrayed by O-ooji, the lord of the western
provinces, to whom the Emperor gave the title of Da zai no
dai ni. The Emperor Go Tsutchi died in such poverty that
his body lay unburied for some days for want of money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>To this date the annals of the Emperors are brought
down. Since the accession of the present dynasty of Shiogoons,
the printing of every work relative to government is
prohibited. There are slight notices of remarkable occurrences
during each year published in an almanac form; as,
for instance, it is noted that in 1533, on the tenth month,
eighth day—<i>i.e.</i>, November—there were observed an extraordinary
number of falling stars, and in 1534 a very fatal
epidemic passed over the country.</p>

<p>1537. During this year disturbances arose between the
Buddhist priests of the Tendai sect of the Hiyaysan monastery,
and those of the Hokkay or Nitchi ren sect. The former
burned down the temple of the latter, and with it nearly
the half of Miako was consumed.</p>

<p>1538. In Kwanto the chiefs were again at war. Hojio
attacked Yamano ootchi in his castle of Kawa goi near Yedo
and routed him by a night attack. Takeda Singeng, now a
lad, turned his father out of his possessions in Kahi.</p>

<p>In 1539, muskets were first known—brought over to
Tanegasima by the Portuguese, pistols being known to this
day by the name of “tanegasima.” According to the “History
of the Church in Japan,” “The islands of Japan were
first discovered in the last century, but at what time is very
uncertain—some say in the year 1534; St. Francis Xavier
believed it was rather five or six years after. Be it as it
will, Father Maffius and others tell us that three Portuguese
merchants, Antony Mora, Francis Zaimor, and Anthony
Pexot, in their voyage from Dodra, in Siam, to China, were
thrown by tempests upon the islands of Japan in 1541, and
put in at the kingdom of Cangoxima.” This is the southern
part of the island of Kiusiu, off which lies the island of Tanega
or Tanesima. Mendez Pinto, who appears to have been
wrecked in this vessel, gives no date, but, from his account,
the sensation caused by the pistols and muskets brought to
this warlike nation seems to have been much greater than
that caused by the apparition of strangers. It is not wonderful
that the year should have been noted in the Japanese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
calendars as that in which firearms were introduced. They
did not anticipate that the arrival of these foreigners was to
be to the empire the source of much trouble. At this time
the Lioo Kioo Islands seem to have been well known to the
buccaneers on the Chinese coast, and with the strong southerly
monsoons, so frequently broken up by typhoons, it was
not likely that Japan could remain long undiscovered; and
the Japanese must have known of Europeans and their customs
from their own sailors trading to China and Singapore.</p>

<p>1540. Mowori Moto nari, ancestor of Choshiu of the present
day, and founder of the family, was embroiled with his
feudal superior, Amako of Idzumo, and gave in his allegiance
to O-ooji. This state of disturbances is noted in the earliest
letters of the Jesuits, written from Amangutchi, the capital
of these provinces, which was afterward visited by Francis
Xavier.</p>

<p>1542. This year was born (26th day of twelfth month)
To sho Shingku—better known as Iyeyas—at Oka saki in
Mikawa; and during the year Ima ngawa and Nobu hide,
father of Nobu nanga, fought a battle at Atsuka Saka in
Mikawa. The Portuguese came to Boongo to trade, and
received a warm reception in the territories of Owotomo.</p>

<p>In 1543 the Portuguese came back again; Owotomo,
Boongo no kami, was then lord of this province, and of a
great part of the island of Kiusiu. An officer, by name
Seito, was sent by him with the Portuguese to Miako.
Hitherto the history of Japan has been made up entirely
from native sources; but after this time the letters of the
Jesuits, and the accounts published from time to time by
Europeans, become of interest. Kagosima, the port of Satsuma
at which these Portuguese merchants first touched, is
not a place adapted for carrying on a large trade. It is too
far out to sea, and cut off from the interior (which is not
fertile) by high ranges of hills. The port offered by Owotomo
was much better suited to their views. It is in the
heart of the inland sea, well sheltered, and, at the same
time, having water-communication with the extensive fringe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
of coast bordering that sea. The island of Sikok, the most
fertile part of Japan, was within easy access. The whole
of the western part of Nippon and the island of Kiusiu could
bring their products to this port by water, while intercourse
with Osaka and the capital was comparatively easy. The
objection to Kagosima applies equally to Nagasaki, which
is cut off from trading communication with the interior of
the country by the difficulty both of its water and land approaches.
The family of Owotomo had gradually risen to
wealth and power in the island of Kiusiu, and at the time
the Jesuits arrived, the Lord or Tono, called by them Francis,
was the greatest of the feudal chiefs then ruling in the island.</p>

<p>1545. Miako was reduced by war and fires to such a state
that it became impossible to live in it; whoever did attempt
to live there ran the risk of being burned, killed, or starved.
The Koongays left, and generally settled under the protection
of some feudal chief in the provinces.</p>

<p>1548. The Shiogoon, who had fled to Sakamoto, returned
to Miako, and Hossokawa was appointed Kwanrei.</p>

<p>1549. Mioshi tchokay, called Mioxindo no in the “History
of the Church” (or Naga Yoshi), took up arms against
Haru moto and the Shiogoon party, and the latter fled again
to Sakamoto, about twelve miles from Miako. Nobu hide,
father of Nobu nanga, died, leaving him, his son, heir of all
the possessions he had acquired. Francis Xavier, then at
Malacca, whither he had gone with the fondness for change
and excitement which seemed to have characterized his career,
met with some of those who were returning to Japan.
He immediately determined to visit it. He arrived in the
year 1549, and left it again in 1551, disappointed and disheartened
with the realities of missionary work. In the
“History of the Church” it is said, in 1549 (p. 72): “On
the way from Amangutchi (Yama ootchi) to Miako the ways
were infested with soldiers, by reason of troubles between
the Dairi and Cubo. Miako inspired Xavier with the desire
of planting there the standard of Christ, but the effect did
not at all answer his expectations. Miako, which signifies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
a thing worth seeing, was no more than the shadow of what
it formerly had been, such terrible fires and wars had laid
it waste, and the present condition of affairs threatened it
with total destruction. All the neighboring princes were
combined against the Cubosama, and nothing was to be
heard but the noise of armies. However, he endeavored
to gain an audience from the Cubosama and Dairi; but his
poverty made him contemptible. It required 10,000 caixes
to gain an audience. To comfort himself he preached in the
streets; but the town being full of confusion, and the thoughts
of every man taken up with reports of war, none listened to
him. After a fortnight’s stay, hearing that the Dairi bore
only the name of a monarch, and that the Cubo was absolute
only in the Tensa and Gokinai, he saw it was nothing
but lost labor and expense to have his leave to preach over
all Japan when he was not master.”</p>

<p>1550. Yoshi haru, late Shiogoon, died. Mioshi tchokay
burned Hingashi yama, or Hiyay san, a collection of monasteries
and temples near Miako.</p>

<p>1551. O-ooji was attacked by the forces of one of his
own officers, Suyay haru kata, who obliged him to fly, and
he committed suicide with several high Koongays who were
residing under his protection. This Suyay had promised
Owotomo, chief of Boongo, to give back to his younger
brother, Yoshi Naga, the command in the province of Suwo.
At the death of O-ooji the seal under which trade with China
had been carried on was lost, and the trade suspended.</p>

<p>1552. At this time the religion of Christ was brought,
according to native accounts, by “Nan bang,” foreigners
from the south, to Boongo. The period at which this event
took place was worthy of note. Japan had been for years
torn by rival factions, and by the contests of men intriguing
for power. The Emperor was powerless, and reduced by
poverty and neglect to a position bordering on contempt.
The eastern court at Kamakura retained some portions of its
former power, and was at least a hotbed where schemes
might be hatched for overthrowing either the power of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
court of Miako, or that of some of the neighboring princes.
Yedo was almost unknown, except as a village dependency
of the castle. The western provinces were under the sway
of independent chiefs, while the island of Kiusiu hardly
acknowledged the authority of the Mikado. A small beginning
of commerce with China had been going on for some
years past, and was conducted with Ningpo. It was not
likely, therefore, that at the first landing upon Tanegasima
the country and people of Japan were unknown to the Portuguese
buccaneers upon the coast of China. Not many
years had elapsed since China had been first visited by the
Portuguese, and Liampo or Ningpo was their northern port.
If Mendez Pinto is to be credited, there were 800 Portuguese
then living near that city under their own laws; but if his
account of the doings of his countrymen in China be correct—and
it is in many things corroborated by concurrent testimony—the
men who sailed about these seas were not exactly
the men best suited to spread a healthy commerce, or to
propagate correct notions of the Christian religion. They
were the buccaneers of that day, and mixed up their business
of piracy and murder with trade and religion in a strange
medley. The vast opening consequent upon the doubling of
the Cape induced these men to push their discoveries further
and further. Europe had just been convulsed by the throes
of delivery of the Church of Rome. Twin children had been
born by the Reformation to the Church, and the schismatic
operations of Luther without gave rise to the crafty strengthening
process of Loyola within the Church. The propagandist
zeal of Jesuitism at this period put forth her strength
to reap the harvest in Japan; but the bane of the Church of
Rome pursued her here, and her desire to make the kingdom
of Christ of this world brought to naught all her schemes.
The Inquisition was in full operation in Portugal and Spain,
where John III. and Philip II. directed the missions of the
Church; and the same zeal was carried into India and all
their foreign possessions. The whole power, political and
ecclesiastical, in the East, was allowed by other nations to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
be in the hands of the King of Portugal: without his permission
no bishop could be appointed; no episcopal see created
without his consent; and he retained the right of filling
up vacancies in every see. No European missionary could
go to the East without his sanction, and with that only in a
Portuguese vessel; and no bull or brief from the Holy See
was of any effect in the East until it had received the approbation
of the King, who in return was supposed to protect
and support the Church of Rome. This was known as the
Protectorate of the Crown of Portugal, and was annually
confirmed by Papal bulls, in which was inserted a clause
whereby the Pope annuled beforehand every bull which any
one of his successors might issue to the contrary. Such was
the epoch at which the Portuguese arrived in Japan.</p>

<p>1553. Mioshi attacked and killed Hossokawa, the minister
of the Shiogoon, and the following year attacked Miako,
whence the Shiogoon fled to Tanba.</p>

<p>1555. Fighting was going on between Mowori moto nari
(ancestor of Mowori Daizen no diaboo) and Suyay haru taka,
who had killed his lord O-ooji. Mowori was victorious, and
gained possession of all the “middle or central provinces”
west of Miako—laying the foundation of the wealth and
power which remain to the family to the present time. An
embassy was sent this year to Japan from China, to complain
of pirates from the island of Kiusiu who were ravaging the
coasts of China.</p>

<p>1557. The Emperor Gonara died. Nobu nanga put to
death his own younger brother Nobu yuki.</p>

<p>1558. Oki matchi ascended the throne at forty-two years
of age. At this time Hideyoshi, better known as Taiko
sama, as a young man became an officer in the service of
Nobu nanga.</p>

<p>1559. Etsingo Nangao Kage tora, a large feudal chief,
went to Miako from his province of Etsingo to pay his respects
to the Emperor, and to claim his installation into the
office of Kwanrei, when his name and designation was
changed to Ooyay Soongi teru tora.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>1560. Ima ngawa, lord of Suruga, was one of the chiefs
who were competing for power. He had raised a large force
and met Nobu nanga, who was not inclined to face him with
a small number such as he then had with him; but Hideyoshi
persuaded him to join issue, and by skill and stratagem
they defeated and killed Ima ngawa, and Nobu nanga took
possession of all his territory.</p>

<p>1561. Iyeyas was infeft by Nobu nanga in the province
of Mikawa, and made the castle of Okasaki his residence.</p>

<p>1562. Mowori moto nari and Owotomo Boongo no kami,
or Zo rin (the great patron of the foreigners in Kiusiu), were
at war, which was terminated by the interference of the Shiogoon,
who sent down a messenger to restore peace, through
a matrimonial alliance and enlargement of Owotomo’s territories.</p>

<p>1563. Fighting was going on in the neighborhood of Yedo
between Sattomi, who possessed large territories in Awa and
Owota, on the one side, and Hojio of Odawara on the other.
A great battle took place between these chiefs at Kowunodai,
near Yedo, in which Sattomi was defeated. The defeat took
place upon the 9th of the ninth month, a festival-day all over
Japan. Since the defeat, Kanagawa and Kawasaki, then
belonging to Sattomi, have held the festival on the 19th.
Mowori Motonari this year completely defeated Amako, the
lord Idzumo, and absorbed his territories, thus becoming lord
of ten provinces.</p>

<p>1564. Nobu nanga killed his father-in-law Seito Do Sang,
the lord of Mino, and seized all his territory, and changed
his own residence, which had been hitherto in Nagoya in
Owarri, to Gifoo in Mino.</p>

<p>In 1565 Matza naga hissa hide (Daxandono, or properly
Danshio, in “History of the Church”) and Mioshi attacked
Yoshi teru, Shiogoon, who was surprised, and committed
suicide. His younger brother Yoshi aki fled to Oomi, shaved
his head, and became a priest. The grandson of Yoshi dzumi
aimed at the position of Shiogoon. To oppose the designs of
Mioshi, who was attempting to assassinate him, Yoshi aki<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
joined Nobu nanga, who put him into the post of Shiogoon
in 1568, and they together attacked and defeated Mioshi.</p>

<p>1569. Nobu nanga found it necessary to begin a crusade
against the Buddhist priests, and their wealthy and powerful
establishments. He attacked and routed and killed Kita
batake, the lord of Isse. He built a palace for the Emperor,
but it was so small and shabby that the Emperor would not
inhabit it, but lived in the temple of Kammo, near Miako.
This year the palace and castle of Nijio was built in Miako,
and has since been occupied by the Shiogoons as their metropolitan
residence.</p>

<p>1570. Nobu nanga was fighting with the lord of the
province of Etsizen, Asakura, who was defeated, and his
territories seized by Nobu nanga.</p>

<p>At this time Nobu nanga, Hideyoshi, and Iyeyas found it
their interest to be friends. Hideyoshi had grown up as an
officer in Nobu nanga’s army, and both are said to have been
jealous of Iyeyas (known as a young man as “Sing Koong”),
probably discerning at this early time superior administrative
talents, as well as a reticence which may have displeased
them. He is said to have been put forward by them into
difficult positions to get rid of him, but the vigor of his character
increased by overcoming the obstacles in his path. He
went to the province of Oomi at the time Nobu nanga was
fighting with the troops of Asayee and Asakura at Anegawa,
and by his timely assistance turned the fortune of the day.</p>

<p>1571. The Buddhist priesthood had at this time arrived
at the height of their power. The arrival of the Roman
Catholics, and the spread of their doctrines, was probably
hailed by many as a relief from the extravagant pretensions
and power of the monasteries, and it was hoped that they
might in some measure balance the power of the Buddhist
priesthood. All over the country these monasteries had become
very wealthy. The monks, bonzes, or bozans, were
very numerous, and their retainers and dependents formed
an army sufficiently powerful to cope with any single chief.
The policy of the Roman Catholics seems to have been from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
the first of an aggressive character, attacking vehemently
the native priests, abusing their characters, and getting up
discussions in public, and thus unnecessarily irritating a very
powerful body in the kingdom. Nobu nanga was very jealous
of the power of these Buddhist monasteries, and hated
the priests. He therefore gave his countenance to these
newcomers, who were delighted, as thinking it showed a
zeal for their mission, while, in truth, it was only to gratify
his hatred of the native bozans. He suddenly fell upon the
largest of the monasteries, the Hiyaysan, also called by the
early writers Freno yama, and Hiyay no yama. The grounds
are said to have been of great beauty, near the lake of Oomi,
and inclosing thirteen valleys; and at the time the Jesuits
arrived in the country there were said to be 500 temples
within the area of the monastery. Nobu nanga burned all
the temples and massacred the priests. These latter had
been joined by some of Nobu nanga’s late opponents, but
he defeated them all.</p>

<p>1572. Takeda Singeng, at Mikatta nga harra in Tootomi,
was fighting with Iyeyas. A great mortality had taken
place in the force of the latter, and he was nearly overcome,
and in great danger, but finally conquered.</p>

<p>The same year the Shiogoon Yoshi aki became embroiled
with Nobu nanga, who arrested him and put him in prison,
thus bringing to a termination the real power of the Ashikanga
family.</p>

<p>During the year Iyeyas was beaten by Takeda near
Mitske; he was obliged to fly, and was pursued across
the Tenrio River to a village, Hamamatchi. During the
night he heard music, and creeping up with some of his
men to listen, they saw Takeda himself sitting enjoying the
music, when one of Iyeyas’s men fired at him with a musket.
He was wounded and gave up the pursuit. He lingered a
while, but at length died of the injury.</p>

<p>1574. All over the country Roman Catholic temples were
being built, exciting the Buddhist priesthood to wrath.</p>

<p>1575. At Nanga shino, in Tootomi, there was some smart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
fighting between Katzu yori, son of Takeda Singeng, and
Iyeyas, as officer of Nobu nanga. Katzu yori was very
powerful, and had a large army with him of well-trained
soldiers, and Nobu nanga was afraid to fight; but Iyeyas
declared that if he would not fight he himself would join
Katzu yori.</p>

<p>1576. Hideyoshi was sent by Nobu nanga to Kiusiu and
the west provinces. As a whim, he this year made a new
name for himself out of the half of the names of two of Nobu
nanga’s officers, Shibata and Niwa, and calling himself Hashiba,
a name by which he is frequently spoken of by the
Jesuits.</p>

<p>1576. Nobu nanga built the castle of Azutchi (called
Anzuquiama in “History of the Church”) in the province
of Oomi; a castle which now belongs to Ee kamong no
Kami.</p>

<p>1577. Matz nanga hissa hide, known in the “History of
the Church” as Daxandono, was killed by Nobu nanga.</p>

<p>1578. Hashiba hide yoshi was this year fighting with
Mowori teru moto, known to the Jesuits as the King of
Amanguchi, and the island of Kiusiu was devastated by
war between Owotomo, son of the Jesuits’ friend, and Shimadzu
of Satsuma, the result being that Owotomo was defeated
and his territory much diminished.</p>

<p>1579. The two Buddhist sects, Jodo shiu and Nitchi ren
shiu, held a great discussion upon religion before Nobu
nanga at Azutchi, known as the “Azutchi rong.”</p>

<p>Akitchi mitzu hide, one of Nobu nanga’s best officers,
seized the province of Tanba. The Ikko shiu, a Buddhist
sect, was very powerful at this time, and had possession of
the castle of Osaka, then known as the temple of Hoonganji.
Nobu nanga, by one of his generals, had been long besieging
it, and had failed in taking it. In 1580 he called in the persuasive
interference of the Emperor, and a compact was
finally made, under which the priests consented to give up
this strong fortress, which has ever since remained in the
hands of the executive power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>1581. Hideyoshi this year overran the province of Harima,
destroying the castle of Miki, and began to build the
chateau of Himeji for himself in that province; while Nobu
nanga, assisted by Iyeyas and Hojio of Odawara, completely
demolished the power of the Takeda family in Kahi.
The war is known as the “Ten moku san” war, from the
place where Takeda concealed and destroyed himself. The
tie between Nobu nanga and his generals seemed to have
been very slight, and he does not appear at any time to
have been considered ruler of the country. On more than
one occasion Iyeyas threatened to leave him and throw his
weight into the opposite scale. In a portrait drawn of Nobu
nanga in the “History of the Church,” he is described as
“a prince of large stature, but of a weak and delicate complexion,
with a heart and soul that supplied all other wants;
ambitious above all mankind; brave, generous and bold, and
not without many excellent moral virtues; inclined to justice,
and an enemy to treason. With a quick and penetrating
wit, he seemed cut out for business; excelling in military
discipline, he was esteemed the fittest to command an army,
manage a siege, fortify a town, or mark out a camp, of any
general in Japan, never using any head but his own: if he
asked advice, it was more to know their hearts than to profit
by their advice. He sought to see into others and to conceal
his own counsel, being very secret in his designs; he laughed
at the worship of the gods, convinced that the bonzes were
impostors, abusing the simplicity of the people and screening
their own debauches under the name of religion.”</p>

<p>This is the character given of him by the Jesuits, who
considered him a friend to their cause and had some hopes
of him as a convert. It agrees in the main with the pictures
drawn of him by the Japanese. Hating the Buddhist
priests, he patronized the Jesuits as a counterpoise, encouraging
them to build even in the neighborhood of his own
palace at Azutchi. Under the encouragement thus given,
the Jesuit priests rose to favor and power at court. The
efforts of the fathers to extend their influence were crowned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
with success, and at this date the position of the church is
described as follows: “Father A. Valignan, superior of
Japan, for convenience of government, divided Japan into
three parts. The first and principal is that island where
Miako stands. They had there three residences of the Society—Meaco,
Anzuquiama (Azutchi-yama in Oomi) and
Takacuqui. In the residence of Miako were two brothers
and two fathers, who preached and celebrated the divine
mysteries daily in a very fair church. In Anzuquiama they
had two fathers and two brothers; the first of these took
care of the church, and of all the Christians round about;
the other instructed the young gentlemen in the seminary,
teaching them their Catechism, and to read and write in
Latin, Portuguese and the language of the country. In
Takacuqui (Itami in Setzu) there was only one father and
one brother. Justo Ucondono (Takayama), governor of the
place, built in it a very handsome church and house for
the fathers, and furnished them with all the necessaries for
their families. About three leagues off were the churches
of Vocayama, Fort Imori in Kawadsi, and Sanga—all dependencies
of this residence. Two leagues from Sanga, Don
Simon Tagandono (Tango no Kami), lord of Yao, had eight
hundred subjects, all Christians. There were also great
numbers of them in Amangutchi, but without any church,
it being expressly against the king’s pleasure.</p>

<p>“The second part of Japan is that which they commonly
call Ximo (Kiusiu). There the Christians had most churches,
and the Jesuits most houses. In the city of Funay, the metropolis
of Bungo, there were both a college and a university,
where they took degrees of masters of arts and doctors of
divinity. There were twenty Jesuits in the college. The
noviceship stood at Vosuqui, where King Francis (<i>i.e.</i>,
Owotomo Boongo no Kami) resided. Besides, they had
two residences—one at the valley of Ju, some seven leagues
from Funay, and another at Nocen—and these four houses
furnished the whole country with evangelical missionaries.
Moreover, they had a house at Facata, in the kingdom of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
Chicuzen, that was tributary to Bungo; but Aquizuqui, having
made himself master of that country, soon beat them
out of those quarters. The kingdom of Chicungo, bordering
upon Chicuzen, had only one church, which was governed
since Riozogi’s conquest by a devout Christian, that prince
being unwilling to entertain any Jesuits in his states. In
the kingdom of Fingo, which Aquizuqui and Riozogi parted
betwixt them, there were two houses of the Society—one in
Amacusa and the other at Fort Fundo; and these two residences
took charge of above twenty other churches in that
country. As for the island of Xequi (Ko Siki), which stands
upon the confines of Amacusa, they had only one church,
with near 5,000 Christians, who were governed by one of
the inhabitants; for the lord of the place, though he was to
permit the fathers to visit them, would not hear of fixing a
residence; which obliged the Christians, on the more solemn
days, to come over to the church of Amacusa.</p>

<p>“In the kingdom of Goto (the five small islands to the
west of Japan), since Don Lewis’s death, there was neither
church nor house, the uncle and tutor to the young prince
being, as was said, a most professed enemy to all religion.
The King of Firando, indeed, though a heathen, was content
to receive two priests and two others for the benefit
of the Christians, and chiefly his uncle and son, Don John
and Don Anthony.</p>

<p>“As for the kingdoms of Omura and Arima, religion
flourished there above all other parts, Bungo only excepted.
The fathers had three houses in Omura, one in Omura itself,
where the King kept his court, another at Nangasak, and a
third at Curi, and out of these three churches they visited
forty several churches, and had charge of some 50,000
Christians that were in that kingdom. In Arima they had
three residences: one in the city of Arima, with five Jesuits,
whereof two had care of the seminary for educating young
nobles, among whom was the King of Fiungas’ son, cousin-german
to the King of Arima, and the rest, all of them
sons to the chief lords in the country; the second at Arie;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
and the third at Cochinozi, a most celebrated port for
commerce.</p>

<p>“In the kingdom of Saxuma, where St. F. Xaverius
landed at his first entrance into Japan, there were some
few Christians whom the fathers visited by times, being all
banished by the bonzes, who acted by the King’s authority.
They reckoned in the kingdom of Ximo upward of 30,000
Christians.</p>

<p>“The third part of Japan (Sikok) contains only four kingdoms,
and of these only the King of Tosa received the faith.
So Father Alex. Valignan, at the end of his visit, upon his
return to the Indies, left 150,000 Christians in Japan, 200
churches and 39 religious of his own order, besides several
able, young and virtuous Japonians who helped to instruct
the new Christians.”</p>

<p>In 1582 Nobu nanga was gradually overrunning all Japan.
He had given the revenues of the island of Sikok to his son,
Nobu taka. “This year he built at Azutchi a splendid temple.
In this temple he collected idols of all the gods of Japan,
and placed in the midst a statue of himself, calling it Xanthi;
<i>i.e.</i>, supreme ruler. He then, like Nebuchadnezzar, issued
an edict prohibiting any one from worshiping any other idol,
and ordered all to resort to this place on his birthday to worship
this representation of himself. The first that adored
was his eldest son. The nobility followed, and then the
gentry and people in their course.” This idol is said to
be in existence at the present day. Nobu nanga, after this
public adoration of his statue, returned to Miako. Akitchi
mitzu hide had been one of his most prominent and successful
generals, and was at this time in the neighborhood of
the capital. Nobu nanga had dispatched a large body of
troops to assist Hashiba Hideyoshi in his operations in the
west. Whether Akitchi aspired to the position occupied by
Nobu nanga, or was really jealous and hated him, in common
with others, as a tyrant, or, as some relate, smarted
under the insult of being struck by Nobu nanga over the
head with a fan, is doubtful. But “when he saw that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
guards and forces under the immediate command of Nobu
nanga were so diminished in number that he was left nearly
unprotected, he took advantage of what seemed to him an
opportunity. He had been ordered by Nobu nanga to take
a large body of troops under his command to join Hideyoshi.
Accordingly, he marched, but, instead of taking the route indicated,
he took aside some of the captains whom he knew
to be dissatisfied with the government, discussed with them
his design, and gained them over by declaiming against the
violence, oppression, and tyranny of Nobu nanga, accusing
him of destroying the gods and murdering the priests, and
concluding by promises of wealth stored up in the castle of
Adzutchi yama. He then suddenly wheeled round upon Miako,
surrounding Honnoji, where Nobu nanga was residing,
before he was aware of any danger. All the avenues were
closed—no escape was left for him. He was washing his
face when the news came that the troops had invested the
place, and opening a window to see what was the matter,
they poured in a shower of darts and wounded him between
the shoulders. The place was soon in flames, and his body
was consumed with the building. Thus died Nobu nanga,
at forty-nine years of age, a little after he took upon himself
the title of god, and had made himself be adored by his
subjects.”</p>

<p>Nobu nanga was by birth of higher origin than his successor,
Taikosama, and, as the son of a feudal prince, had,
at a time when might gave right, some pretension to rule.
Descended from Kio mori, he was of the Taira family, that
clan which had contested so long with the Minnamoto for
the executive power in the empire. No question of family
origin entered into his rise or brought about his fall. As
an individual, he rose to power through his military talents;
and probably from want of administrative ability failed to
strengthen himself, or insure to his sons the succession of
the position to which he had risen. The period of his rule
was signalized by the rise and success of the Jesuits, whom
he countenanced, according to their own showing, rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
from hatred to the Buddhist priests than from love for the
doctrines of Christianity, or respect for the Roman Catholic
priesthood. When he died, the tide of prosperity turned
and ebbed till it gradually swept the whole doctrines, priests,
and proselytes from the shores of Japan.</p>

<p>Akitchi mitsu hide, who had thus removed the master-spirit
of Japan, was not the man to take the vacant seat.
Apparently an able second, a successful lieutenant, he was
wanting in every quality for command. He had gained over
the troops placed in his charge by the promise of plunder.
He marched them upon the city of Azutchi-yama, where
Nobu nanga had stored up the treasures he had accumulated
during many years, and in three days squandered the whole
in largesses to those under his command.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>GOVERNMENT OF TAIKOSAMA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the sudden and unexpected removal of the keystone
of the arch, there was left a blank to be filled up. It may
be said that on either side was a stone ready for the purpose.
On the one side, Hideyoshi, in command of a powerful army,
and he himself with a great reputation as a leader and engaged,
on the part of Nobu nanga, in a war with Mori, prince
of the ten western provinces; on the other, Iyeyas, firmly
seated as ruler over eight provinces, and hardly acknowledging
any submission to the executive at Miako, also in command
of an army and fighting on the side of Nobu nanga
against Hojio, lord of Odawara. Had the succession been
left to the son or sons of Nobu nanga, there was every prospect
of a continuance of the same state of anarchy and war.
No one of the three was competent for the post. The eldest,
indeed, had perished with his father, leaving a son, a child,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
San hoshi. The third, Nobu taka, was lord of the island of
Sikok and its four provinces. Nobu wo, lord of Owarri, the
second son, took part with Hideyoshi.</p>

<p>Iyeyas Mikawa no kami seems, during his career, to have
occupied a position apart in the empire. This is attributed
by his countrymen to a recognition by Nobu nanga and
Hideyoshi of his great talents as a general in command
during war, they being always either jealous or afraid of
him. He had been nearly uniformly successful in war, even
when fighting against great odds. They had put him into
dangerous positions in the hope of getting rid of him, but
he had always come out of them with additional credit and
invariable success. He was ready to obey and equal to command.
Unwilling to thrust himself forward, he could bide
his time, and was prepared for any emergency. He was
born of a good family, but had cut out for himself a position;
and, in the general scramble for landed possessions at
this period, had laid a solid foundation in the province of
Suruga and Mikawa and some portions of other provinces.
He had already been advanced to high rank by the Emperor.
He resided at Hamamatz, in Towotomi, where he held over
the Kwan to supreme sway, with which Taikosama did not
think it wise to interfere.</p>

<p>Hideyoshi, as has been related, was of low origin, and
his birth and lineage a matter of obscurity; but in such estimation
are some sorts of pedigree held in Japan (as in other
places) that he contrived to make it appear that his mother
was pregnant with him before she married his reputed father,
Kinoshta mago yaymong. According to his own accounts,
his mother was daughter of Motchihagee, a Koongay, and
during the troubles she was obliged to fly, and, falling into
great distress, married Kinoshta. She married a second
husband, Tchikoo ami. Before her second marriage, she
one night dreamed that she had conceived by the sun, and
thence her child was called Hi yoshi maro. He was commonly
called Ko chikoo (small boy). His face was small,
and he was like a monkey, whence he got the nickname of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
Saru matz; and, even long afterward, when he was Kwanbakku,
he was called Saru Kwanja, or monkey with a crown.
When a child, he was very cunning and reckless, and lived
on the streets. A story is told of him lying asleep on a bridge
in Okasaka. Among others who passed was Hiko yay mong,
a noted robber from Owarri. He gave the boy a kick, and
asked him his name. He said, “Saru matz. This is the
public road, and is as much mine as yours. Who are you?”
He said, “I am Hiko yay mong.” “Well,” says the boy,
“Hiko is a thief and a robber, and I have as good a right to
be here as he.” He long afterward made Hiko a Daimio—the
family as Hatchiska existing to the present time. He
went, when ten years of age, to Hama matz, where his master,
observing the talent in the boy, recommended him to
turn a soldier. He afterward entered the service of Nobu
nanga, and called himself Kinoshta Tokitchiro. When he
rose in military rank, he took the name of Hashiba Hideyoshi
Tchikuzen no kami. In 1583, upon the death of Nobu
nanga, he rose rapidly in imperial rank from lieutenant-general
to be Naidaijin and Kwanbakku. As it was unheard-of
presumption in any one not of the Fusiwarra family being
Kwanbakku, he asked, extorted, or adopted this family name
from the Emperor. But he seems never to have used it, and
is known by that of Toyo tomi, given him by the Emperor.
In no long time after, he rose to be Dai jo dai jin. He was
Kwanbakku during seven years, when he retired under the
usual title of Taiko, given to that officer on retiring, and was
known by the name of Taiko sama, or the Taikosama. After
the destruction of Azutchi, the city of Nobu nanga, Hideyoshi
fixed upon Fusimi and Osaka as his places of residence, taking
possession of the castle of Osaka, which commands the
town, adding to its strength by immense fortifications, and
building in the center a palace of great magnificence. This
castle had formerly belonged to one of the powerful Buddhist
sects, and had been wrested from them by Nobu nanga. By
command of Taikosama, immense canals were dug, and, by
artificial means, smaller rivers were led into that flowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
past Osaka, by which, the importance of the town as a commercial
capital, as well as its strength as a fort, was materially
increased. In Miako he built another magnificent
palace, known as Jui raku; and had another at Fusimi,
between Miako and Osaka. He had married, during his
youth, a woman of his own rank. He afterward married
the daughter of Fusi yee; and, thirdly, the daughter of
Gamo Hida no kami. His fourth wife was the daughter
of Kio goku; and the fifth, the daughter of Mayedda of
Kanga; and, lastly, Yodo hime dono, daughter of Azai
Bizen no kami, of whom the Jesuit letters speak as Kita
Mandocoro “quæ est primaria Taici conjunx carissima erat
et conjunctissima.” But notwithstanding this plurality of
wives, it was never pretended that he had a son till his old
age. He had a stepbrother, Hide nanga, and a stepsister,
who married Musasi no kami, and had two sons, Hidetsoongu
(who was adopted by Hideyoshi) and Gifoo sho
sho. Another stepsister had a son, Hide toshi, who was
adopted by Hide nanga. Hidetsoongu (nephew of Taiko by
his stepsister), who was afterward Kwanbakku, was first
adopted by Miyoshi Yamashiro no kami, and afterward by
Taikosama. Taikosama also adopted Hideyuki kingo, son
of Kinoshta, the brother of his wife.</p>

<p>The following account of Taikosama is taken from the
letters of the Jesuits: “This man (Faxiba, or Hashiba), who
was most certainly immoderately ambitious, seeing his master
dead, and with him his eldest son, who had left only one
child not full three years old; moreover, finding the second
son to be but a weak man, and the third destitute both of
fortune and strength to make head against him, he believed
it would be easy to content him by a donation of some government,
and so the way was fairly open for himself to step
into the throne. To carry on his design, he first sounded all
the officers of his army, and finding them tight to his interest,
for a color of his ambition he took upon him the title of
tutor and governor to the young prince and heir to the empire,
and put him into a fortress with a train answerable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
his birth. Nobu nanga’s third son soon smelled out his design,
and not able to brook one of his father’s subjects in the
government of his kingdoms, he leagued with several of the
lords who were grown jealous of Faxiba’s power, and resolved
to make it a trial of skill; but Faxiba, who was an
old experienced captain, and had good troops under him,
easily defeated them, and put all to death that durst oppose
his designs.” This is hardly correct, inasmuch as, though
he marched into the province of Mino in pursuit of Nobu
taka, third son of Nobu nanga, and defeated him, he was
not so successful in his action against Nobu wo, the second
son, in the year 1584. This latter, without much talent, had
wit enough to ask Iyeyas to assist him. He came to his assistance,
and in the battles of Komaki and Nangakute, with
greatly inferior forces numerically, defeated, first, Hidetsoongu,
Taikosama’s nephew, and afterward Taikosama
himself. Taiko thought it more prudent to make a compact,
and having done so, retired to Miako, which Iyeyas
permitted him to do without further action.</p>

<p>“Among the confederates of Nobu taka was one Shibata
dono, brother-in-law to Nobu nanga. He was besieged in
the fortress of Shibatta, and seeing no way of escape, he,
having dined with his friends, wife, and children, and retainers,
set fire to the castle, first killing his wife, his children,
and the female servants; and his friends, following
his example, afterward committed suicide, ‘and lay there
wallowing in their blood till the fire kindled and burned
them to ashes.’” Some of the arms and clothes which were
found unburned are said to be all kept to the present day as
they were found after this catastrophe.</p>

<p>“Faxiba, being now in peaceable possession of the Tense
(or imperial provinces), and all Nobu nanga’s other kingdoms,
to give color to his usurpation affected an affable
sweetness, which charmed all that ever saw or heard him.
None, besides the Christians, could in the least suspect the
sincerity of his intentions; and not long after they, too,
were quieted of all their fears; for, knowing very well how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
respectful they had been to Nobu nanga, either out of real
affection, or for that he had no mind to make himself new
enemies, he began to caress them, and gave them several
particular instances of his favor. He knew the Christians
in his service to be famous, both for their piety and their
courage; and, above all, he showed a particular respect for
Justo Ucondono (properly called Takayama oo konyay no
kami), to whom he had been indebted for his good fortune.</p>

<p>“So when the fathers went to visit him, he treated them
after the same manner and with the same ceremony as Nobu
nanga had done before him; and for instance of his real intentions,
he appointed them a place for building a church
and seminary (in Osaka), as was done before in Anzuquiama.
The Queen, his lady, had also several of the Christians
among her maids of honor, whom Faxiba particularly
respected for their singular modesty and piety. He permitted
them to assist at mass and sermons, and was pleased
to show a liking when any of his subjects became Christians,
which emboldened them to preach and exercise their other
functions with greater liberty than formerly, to the great
increase of the faithful. Faxiba, who was advertised of it,
far from being displeased, declared he would embrace the
Christian religion himself were it but a little more indulgent
to flesh and blood.”</p>

<p>Taikosama was feeling his way in the novel position in
which he found himself after Nobu nanga’s death. The
Jesuits did not know how their position might be affected.
They had basked in the sunshine of court favor for some
years past; that might now be clouded over. The bozangs,
or native Buddhist priesthood, had been standing in the cold
shade for some years; they had everything to hope for in a
change. There was not much to be feared from Sanhoshi,
the infant grandson of Nobu nanga, as a claimant to the
throne. Mowori in the west was quiet. Iyeyas in the east
was occupied in attacking Hojio of Odawara, who was supposed
to be in opposition to the government. Hojio was superior
in the number of his forces, but inferior in the ability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
of his commanders. The proverbial saying of an “Odawara
Hio jio”—that is, an Odawara deliberation—took its origin
in the councils of war of Hojio at this time, which, with superior
forces, were protracted till Iyeyas attacked, defeated
him, and took the Castle of Odawara.</p>

<p>In the year 1583 the Jesuit fathers prevailed upon the
Christian converts Arima and Omura and Owotomo Boongo
no kami to send some young lords on a visit to the Pope.
Four were sent, two of them being relatives of these lords,
and the other two sons of nobles. They were all four boys
of the age of from fifteen to sixteen. They took letters with
them to Pope Gregory XIII. Leaving Japan on February
22, 1583, they, going by Macao and Goa, reached Lisbon
on August 10, 1584, and after an interview with Philip at
Madrid, arrived in Rome on March 20, 1585, where they
were received by the Pope, and kissed his feet. They re-embarked
at Lisbon the last day of April, 1586, with seventeen
religious of the Society, reaching Goa on May 29, 1587,
and finally arrived in Japan in 1590, “eight years from their
first setting out,” bringing with them an Arabian horse,
which had been presented to them by the Viceroy of India.</p>

<p>In 1583 Taikosama finished the fortress of Osaka, a work
which consumed a great deal of money and occupied a great
number of men, and which, when finished, covered a much
larger space of ground than that upon which the castle now
stands. During this year the island of Kiusiu was the theater
of war. Riozoji held an office, now done away with, as
governor of the island. He had formerly been a vassal of
the small lordship of Arima, but now had large landed possessions
in the island: and being too desirous of extending
his own territory at his neighbors’ expense, they joined together
and rooted him out.</p>

<p>In 1585 Taikosama received from the Emperor the family
name of Toyotomi. He called himself Fusiwara, and
insisted on the Emperor appointing him Kwanbakku. He
had now had sufficient time to feel himself settled in his
position; but he thought the native monasteries were still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
too powerful, notwithstanding the demolition of Hiyayzan,
the large monastery near Miako, and the slaughter of great
numbers of priests by Nobu nanga, together with the appropriation
as a castle of the large monastery in Osaka. The
sect of Negoros [Negroes in the Church of Japan] at Kumano,
in the province of Kii, occupied a very large monastery,
to which the whole of the province belonged in territorial
right, the military retainers of the monastery being
noted for prowess and skill in fighting. Taikosama having
found or made some cause of quarrel moved against them,
defeated them, and destroyed the monastery. Most of these
retainers were removed to Yedo, where to this day they form
part of the guard of the Shiogoon.</p>

<p>This year Taikosama sent Nobuwo to order Iyeyas to
come to Miako. He refused to come until it was arranged
that Taikosama’s mother should come to Yedo as a hostage
during his absence, when Iyeyas went to pay his respects to
the Emperor. Mowori, lord of the western provinces, was
also ordered to come to Miako to acknowledge Taikosama
as his superior, an order which he found it prudent to obey.
In 1586 Iyeyas married the youngest sister of Taikosama.</p>

<p>A persecuting spirit showed itself among the Jesuits
very soon after the departure of Francis Xavier. “Sumitanda,”
they write, “King of Omura, who had become a
Christian in accordance with a promise to that purpose in
case his wife should have a child, about the year 1562, or
only thirteen years after the first arrival of a missionary in
the country, declared open war against the devils. He dispatched
some squadrons through his kingdom to ruin all the
idols and temples, without any regard to the bonzes’ rage.”
All this, doubtless, was done by the advice and at the instigation
of his instructors; and “in 1577 the lord of the island
of Amacusa issued his proclamation, by which all his subjects—whether
bonzes, gentlemen, merchants or tradesmen—were
required either to turn Christians or to leave the
country the very next day. They almost all submitted, and
received baptism, so that in a short time there were more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
than twenty churches in the kingdom. God wrought miracles
to confirm the faithful in their belief.”</p>

<p>All this time one of the most zealous as well as influential
among the Christian converts was he who was known as
Justo Ucondono, or Takayama oo konyay no kami. His seat
was Takaski, in the province of Setsu, where “he labored
with a zeal truly apostolical to extirpate the idolaters out of
his states, where the number was now fallen to 30,000. He
sent word that they should either receive the faith or be gone
immediately out of his country, for he would acknowledge
none for his subjects but such as adored the true God.
This declaration obliged them all to accept of instruction,
which cut out work enough for all the fathers and missionaries
at Meaco.” Taikosama still continued his wonted
favors to the Christians, “saying one day, in a familiar
way, that he would willingly become a Christian himself if
they could dispense with him in polygamy.” In this way
the Roman Catholics set the example of intolerance, driving
those opposed to them in religious belief out of the country.
True disciples, and breathing the spirit of the Inquisition,
then in full blow in Spain and Portugal, they would not
allow within their own states that freedom under which the
tree planted by them had taken root and was flourishing.</p>

<p>Takayama brought over as a convert, among others, the
young admiral of Taikosama’s fleet—Don Austin, as he is
known to the Jesuits; Konishi, Setsu no kami, Yuki Naga,
as his title is in native history. He and his father and
mother were baptized in 1584.</p>

<p>Taikosama, wishing to keep Takaski, gave Takayama in
its stead another estate, Akashi, in Harima; and as “soon
as Justo had taken possession of it, his first thoughts were
to reduce it under the obedience of Christ. The bonzes,
smelling his design, with their idols went to cast themselves
at the Queen’s feet. The Queen, touched with an
ardent zeal for her religion, spoke to the King in their behalf.
But Faxiba, who was no bigot, answered her briskly
that he had absolutely given Justo that place in change of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
Tacacuqui; and for the rest, every one was free to dispose
of his own. Let the bonzes, if the idols be troublesome,
drown them in the sea, or dry them for fuel. Don Justo,
much pleased with Faxiba’s answer, took then a resolution
to oblige all his subjects to become Christians,” and thus
first taught them a lesson which they afterward practiced
upon himself. Justo had the merit, in his religious zeal, of
being unconnected with any seaport town. All the other
lords who had been brought over to the Roman Church were
competing more or less for foreign trade—Boongo, Arima,
Omura, Firando, Grotto; and though some of them seem to
have been sincere converts, others wavered with the rise
and fall of exports and imports. Such, for example, may
the King of Boongo be called, when he returned the following
answer to the bozangs: “These good fathers have been
thirteen or fourteen years in my kingdom. At their arrival
I had only three kingdoms; they are now swelled to five.
My treasury was exhausted; it now exceeds any other prince
in all Japan. I had no male issue to succeed me, but now
Heaven has blessed me with heirs. Everything has succeeded
and prospered since they came among us. What
blessing did I ever receive from your gods since I began to
serve them? Begone! and never speak ill those I love
and respect.” This Boongo no kami on one occasion during
war destroyed a most prodigious and magnificent temple
with a colossal statue, burning 3,000 monasteries to ashes.
“This ardent zeal of the prince is an evident instance of his
faith and charity,” says the Jesuit writer.</p>

<p>This year, upon the occasion of the arrival of the Father
Provincial of Japan at Osaka, Justo and Austin demanded
an audience for him with Taikosama. “To make the way
more easy, he exposed, according to the custom of the country,
his presents for the King and Queen. He was introduced
(his majesty accepting the presents) to Taikosama
seated on a magnificent throne, and was received by him
with the most marked kindness and condescension. He
commended them for taking so long a voyage to publish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
in those parts the law of their God. He gave them supper.
After the collation he entertained them with a long
discourse about his government, told them he intended to
make one-half of Japan embrace the Christian religion, and
that he had thoughts of passing into China, not to pillage
and plunder the country, but to reduce it under the sweet
yoke of his obedience. To this end he intended to put to sea
with a fleet of 200 men-of-war. Moreover (and this is the
gist of the conversation), he desired to hire upon any terms
two stout ships of Portugal, well armed and manned, and
by means of the fathers made himself sure of gaining this
point. After the conquest of China, he would build temples
to the true God in all the cities and towns through his empire,
and withal oblige his subjects universally by public
edict to become Christians.</p>

<p>“He afterward conducted them through his palace to
the ninth story of a pyramidal building, whence they had
a beautiful view of the country around Osaka. He then
alluded to the famous discussion between F. Froes and the
Buddhist high-priest, saying that at the time he was so incensed
at the brute, the insolent bozang, that if he had been
in power he would have taken off his head.”</p>

<p>At this meeting the Provincial put in a petition to Taikosama,
which he is said by the Jesuits to have granted; viz.,
“That it should be lawful for them to preach the law of the
true God through all his states, and his subjects free to embrace
it. That their houses should be exempt from lodging
soldiers. That, as strangers, they should be exempt from
all cesses and taxes which the lords do usually lay upon their
vassals. And he added to that, that he gave them license
to preach, not only in his kingdoms, but through all Japan,
as lords and sovereigns of the whole empire.”</p>

<p>Such being the inclinations and views of Taikosama toward
the Jesuits in the outset of his reign, by what means, it
may be asked, was he brought to a change? The statements
of the Jesuits are the sole authority for this part of history;
but they seem to have played their cards badly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>“Religion in Japan within this thirty-eight years past,
when St. Francis Xaverius sowed, the first seeds in that uncultivated
soil, has now grown so fair and flourishing that
one might well compare it to an orange tree loaded on all
sides with fruits and blossoms. It was a field cultivated by
the workmen of the vineyard, and watered with kindly
showers from heaven, which gave fair hope of a rich and
plentiful harvest. It was a ship under full sail drove by
the wind of the Holy Ghost, discovering daily new places
and countries.</p>

<p>“In the year 1587 they reckoned above 200,000 Christians
in Japan, among whom were several persons of distinguished
merit—kings, princes, generals of armies, principal lords of
the court, and, in a word, the flower of the Japonian nobility.
Moreover, what by Cambacundono’s [Taikosama’s]
esteem of our religion, and kindness to the missioners that
preached it, and what by his contempt of the bonzes, whom
he persecuted with fire and sword, burning their temples and
pulling down their idols wherever he came—what, also, by
vesting the Christian lords in the most considerable places
of the government, and indulging liberty to all his court
to receive baptism, over and above, by erecting so many
churches to the true God, and so particularly countenancing
the fathers of the Society—the number of them daily
increased. For, not content with sending frequently for the
fathers to his palace, he went one day himself to visit the
Provincial on board of his ship, and discoursed him after a
familiar way for several hours together. Not that he had
any thoughts of religion, for he was so proud that he pretended
equality with Divinity itself, but by this had a mind
to gain a reputation among the princes of Europe.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, these fair appearances put several of the
principal lords in a humor of being instructed, and the number
of the proselytes was so great that the fathers could
rest neither day nor night. They were taken up continually
with preaching, baptizing, and instructing such as earnestly
desired this sacrament, among whom was Cambacundono’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
own nephew, a prince about nineteen years of age, presumptive
heir to the crown.</p>

<p>“While the Church was in this profound peace, the devil,
foreseeing an entire conversion of the whole empire must follow,
raised such a furious tempest as drove the ship of the
Japonian Church upon the rocks, and split it all to pieces.”
So writes one of the Jesuit fathers. He then looks about to
find a reason for the foundering of the vessel, and finds it
anywhere but in the pilots or officers of the ship. The
unlucky merchants, whether the failure be ecclesiastical or
political, are sure to be made the first scapegoats. Their
lives were so dissolute that the immaculate Taikosama was
horrified. This not being completely satisfactory, it was
further found that “the scandal was so great that Cambacundono,
who had notice of it, began to conceive an ill
opinion of the Christian religion, and concluded the fathers
only used it for a sconce to some underhand intrigue of reducing
the empire of Japan under the obedience of some
Christian prince.” After these two preliminary reasons,
the father goes on to assign other causes. “The first was
his pride, which rendered him extremely sensible of the least
contradiction.” At his interview with the Provincial at
Osaka, above narrated, his object was to obtain some large
foreign vessels to transport troops to China. Hearing that
one had “arrived at Firando, he requested it might be sent
round to Facata, in Boongo, that he might see it. The captain
said it was impossible, owing to the draught of water
of the vessel. Taikosama seemed satisfied, but the same
night he sent orders to the fathers to depart from Japan
within twenty days, and forbade them to preach the Gospel
on pain of death.” To justify himself, he gave out that “he
did this because the Christian faith was contrary to the received
and established religion of Japan, that he had long
since designed to abolish it, and only deferred the execution
till he had conquered Ximo [Kiusiu], where the Christians,
being so numerous, might have formed a party against him.</p>

<p>“Besides,” says the father, “the main refusal, we discovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
afterward two main reasons that put him upon this
edict. The first was a design of ranking himself among the
gods, by which he hoped to make himself be adored by all
his subjects as one of the chief conquerors of Japan. Now
knowing that none but Christians would dare to oppose him,
he took a resolution of exterminating them forthwith before
they could have time to make a party against him.</p>

<p>“The other cause of his aversion to religion was his own
lewd life and conversation. Because some of the Christian
ladies of Arima had rejected the proposal made by a bozang
of entering his service, he was enraged against the whole
religion, and resolved to be revenged on the whole body of
Christians.” This bozang, Jacunin (or Shiaku), had probably
been a resident on the estate of Takayama, or Justo
Ucondono, at Takaski, or at Akashi, and had smarted under
the severity of the treatment by Justo, in turning out of
house and home every one not of his way of thinking. This
priest is said to have directed his master’s wrath against
Takayama. “All the forces in the empire being in his power
as general, and he the greatest bigot of the sect, it was well
if, under the mask of religion, he did not underhand form
a league against the state.” The consequence was, that a
dispatch was immediately forwarded to Takayama, confiscating
his estate, depriving him of his offices, and reducing
him at once to beggary. Takayama on the occasion
seems to have displayed great magnanimity, and acted from
a deep Christian feeling. He might have temporized and
dallied till the wrath of Taikosama had cooled down, or he
might have committed suicide, as a native noble would have
done, and preserved his name as a hero and his estate to his
son. After prayer, the whole family—his father and mother,
men, women, children, and servants—immediately put themselves
on their way, with what little baggage they could
carry. They found a retreat in the territory of Setsu no
kami, Don Austin.</p>

<p>At this time Taikosama issued the following proclamation:
“Being informed by the lords of our Privy Council<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
that certain foreign, religious were entered into our states,
where they preach a law contrary to the established religion
of Japan, and impudently presume to ruin the temples of the
Camis and Fotoquis, though this attempt deserve the very
utmost severity, yet out of our royal clemency we do only
hereby command them upon pain of death to depart from
Japan in twenty days, during which time it shall not be
lawful for any one to hurt them; but if afterward any of
them shall be found in our states, our will and pleasure is
that they be apprehended and punished as in cases of high
treason. As for the Portuguese merchants, we give them
free leave to traffic and reside in our ports till further order;
but withal we do hereby strictly forbid them, on pain of
having both their ships and merchandises confiscated, to
bring over with them any foreign religious.”</p>

<p>That this change should sooner or later have come is not
to be wondered at. That it should have shown itself so suddenly
is in accordance with Japanese ideas of policy and
the character of the Japanese mind. The empire had been
for years, almost ages, torn by internal divisions among
small chiefs. The object of Nobu nanga had been to bring
them all into one under himself. His lieutenant, Taikosama,
totally illiterate, though perhaps not more so than
those around him, had been imbued with his master’s
views. The Buddhist monasteries had been hotbeds of
sedition and foci of disturbance, being at the same time
large political and military powers of perhaps the second
rank, and they had made themselves obnoxious on different
occasions by marked insolence to the generals, and even to
Nobu nanga himself. They had not even the justification
of having preserved (as monasteries did of old in Europe)
the literature of the country, not one priest being able to
read, or teach the rising generation the rudiments of the
written character.</p>

<p>When the Jesuits appeared with meek and lowly appearance,
Nobu nanga was charmed with the prospect of establishing
them as a counterpoise to the haughty and insolent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
Buddhists. He nourished them, showering favors upon
them, and in every way encouraging them, more especially
borne, as they were, on the wings of wealth and trade.
They found Japan, so far as religions went, a free country,
where all religions were tolerated so long as they did
not become aggressive. But they did not come from a free
country. Their ideas were not those of religious tolerance.
By a decree of Gregory XIII., January 28, 1585, all priests
and religious whatever except Jesuits were prohibited from
going to preach in Japan. This was confirmed by Clement
VIII., March 14, 1597; and Philip II. of Spain wrote soon
after to his viceroy in the Indies to see the order punctually
obeyed. This monarch was wielding the power as King of
Portugal. No priest could come to Japan without his sanction.
He had the power of putting his veto on the appointments
made by the Pope. The fires of the Inquisition were
blazing. The wish of the Jesuits was, that those who differed
from them in religious views should be burned as heretics,
to be damned; their hope was that they themselves,
holding the true faith, might be burned as martyrs, to be
beatified. Doubtless the archives of Simancas could unfold
many a letter breathing such thoughts written from Japan,
possibly noted by Philip’s own hand.</p>

<p>They had hitherto sailed with a fair wind. It may be
believed, without going to the full length of taking everything
in their letters for truth, or, on the other hand, accepting
all that is said against them in the work “La Morale
pratique des Jesuites,” or “L’Esprit de Mons. S. Arnauld,”
that they had done some good. Many had been won over
from a state of brutishness to submission in their daily walk
and conversation to the precepts of the Gospel. Some had
gone through severe trials and persecutions, and had stood
firm to their professions. Each of the lords of Boongo,
Arima and Omura had suffered more or less for the faith
they professed. Though the fathers themselves give us a
weapon to attack their conversions when they at one time
assure us that “to win the favor of Taikosama put several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
of the principal lords in a humor of being instructed, and
the number of proselytes was so great that the fathers could
not rest day or night preaching, instructing and baptizing
such as earnestly desired this sacrament” (among whom
was Cambacundono’s own nephew, Hidetsoongo), it might
be asked, What sort of converts were these? and how could
these fathers abuse this sacrament in baptizing persons to
win the favor of such a master?</p>

<p>But these fathers appear to have looked upon the bozangs
as their personal enemies. They thought that it was their
special mission to root them out. They would not let the
tares and the wheat, as they looked upon the respective parties,
grow together. They attacked these priests wherever
they met them. Francis Xavier, at the commencement of
his missionary life in Japan, visited these “bonzes, with the
design, if it were possible, to convert them to Christ, being
persuaded that Christianity would make little progress
among the people if they who were generally looked upon
as oracles of truth opposed the preaching of the Gospel.”
He declared himself much astonished that in Japan the
people “have a profound respect for the bonzes; for though
they be conscious of their hypocrisy and debaucheries, yet
at the same time they worship them like deities, and pay
them all imaginable submission.”</p>

<p>One of the first duties of a missionary should be to learn
thoroughly the religion of the people of the country to which
he is sent. An acquaintance with Buddhism, and its tenets
and principles, would have been a very powerful weapon to
convince or to condemn these priests, without trying to hold
them constantly up to the scorn of their own people and followers.
From the commencement of the Romish missions
a continued aggressive action appears to have been kept up
against the Buddhist priesthood as individual men. The
lives and the morals, or the want of morals, of these men
seem to have been the constant theme of the Jesuit addresses
to the people.</p>

<p>It cannot be wondered at that a body which was politically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
strong enough to cause uneasiness to the monarch of a
country like Japan should not sit quietly under such attacks.
We have no objection to you making converts, they may
have said; but when it came to breaking down temples and
destroying the images, a spirit of intense opposition was
aroused. But when to this a system of persecution was
added—such as that pursued by Don Justo in his territories,
when every one not of his religion was driven out, when the
property of the temples was taken from them, and perhaps
given to their opponents—only one end can be looked for;
viz., that one party should be victorious over the other, and
that by a war to the knife, a struggle of life and death.
The Buddhists were roused. They could live alongside of
Confucianism, or of Taouism in the Yamabooshi, or of the
different sects among themselves; but with the new sect,
this Roman Catholicism, which broke its neighbor’s temples
down, abused him to his face, and then turned every one out
wherever it had the power of doing so—the only method with
it was to use its own weapons and turn it out—to root it out
of the country.</p>

<p>This Inquisition mode of dealing could have ended in no
other way. Japan was not Spain, as the Jesuits found out.</p>

<p>The Buddhists felt that they were worsted on both sides—by
the military power on the one side, which had defeated
their soldiers, burned their monasteries, confiscated their
lands, and appropriated their temples; by the Jesuits, who
had seduced their people, abused themselves, robbed them
of their tithes and offerings, broken down their gods, and
burned the temples, and were now attempting to make converts
in the palace itself, being in such favor as to be received
by Taikosama as he received no other.</p>

<p>Taikosama was probably a proficient in the Japanese art
of dissembling. At first he was doubtful to which party to
incline; but when he had once made sure, after his defeat
of the Negoros and seizure of their territory in Kii, that the
Buddhists were thoroughly subdued, there could be little
doubt, knowing the man, but that he would not give it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
that which was threatening to be the cause of renewed disturbance
in the empire, and whose emissaries thought they
had a right to reprove him whenever it pleased them to do
so. But it was Japanese policy to flatter them, to amuse
them, to dissemble with them till the moment of making the
spring. Inflamed by the Buddhist priests around him, he
made up his mind that the new sect must be rooted out. In
the year 1586 Nagasaki was taken from the Prince of Omura
by Taiko, and made a government port and property. At
that time, native history tells us, Satsuma and Owotomo
were fighting. To this war Taikosama put an end. Some
“battereng,” or padres, came to Tsikuzen to see Taiko. He
did not like Roman Catholics. He found that two of his
own servants were of that faith; they were speared at the
temple of Hatchimang at Hakazaki. The padres were sent
away. Thirteen churches were destroyed. At that time
the province of Tsikuzen belonged partly to Owotomo and
partly to Satsuma. Taikosama took it from both, and gave
all Hizen and Tsikuzen to Nabeshima, formerly a servant
of Riozoji, and whose descendants hold it to this day. He
now fixed that Nagasaki was to be the only place where foreign
trade was to be permitted.</p>

<p>The proclamation of 1587 caused the greatest dismay in
the minds of the Christians. The heads of the church determined
that they would, at all hazards, keep their posts.
They took refuge in the territories of Boongo, Arima, Omura,
Firando and Amacusa, alleging that they were waiting until
a ship was ready to take them away. When the time arrived,
and the ship ready, the captain excused himself from
carrying the fathers this year, as his ship was already over-laden,
sending a letter to Taikosama, which did not reach
him for several months. He was very angry, and took
down the churches in the neighborhood of Miako. At the
same time he ordered Don Austin to exchange his lands
near Miako for others in Kiusiu.</p>

<p>A meeting was held in Firando in August, 1587, at which
the heads of the church decided that the proclamation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
Taikosama was not to be obeyed, but that prayers were to
be offered up, and that Christians were to keep quiet, in the
hope that the storm might blow over.</p>

<p>The following character of Taikosama is given by one of
the Jesuit writers: “He reigned in profound peace, and to
conserve it he observed these rules in his government. First,
After subduing his enemies, and an act of pardon, he never
put any one to death, as Nobu nanga, his predecessor, had
done, who never spared any of the great ones, which rendered
his government odious and cruel; but Taikosama not
only spared their lives, but further assigned them sufficient
pensions to live on, which made them easy and well content.</p>

<p>“Secondly, He forbade all quarrels and private heats, on
grievous penalties, and whoever were found transgressing in
this kind were punished with death. If any of these fled,
they punished the relations in his place; and in default of
relations, his domestics; and in default of these his next
neighbors, who were all crucified for not preventing the
disorder. No doubt great injustice was committed by this
means, and several innocent people suffered. But yet the
fear of death made all zealous and careful to stifle these
animosities and heats in their very birth, and forced them
to live quiet.</p>

<p>“Thirdly, Though he was a tyrant, he would have justice
done immediately on all criminals, without regard to
birth, quality, services or any alliance whatever; and the
party, upon the first conviction of his crime, was put to
death out of hand, though he were one of his own relations
and of the very blood-royal itself. He was most lewdly addicted
to women, nevertheless he pretended that none had a
right to use these debauches but himself, and expressly forbade
any of his subjects to keep a concubine.</p>

<p>“Another means of preventing troubles was to keep both
soldiers and gentry busy employed; for he put them upon
building palaces, raising fortresses, etc., knowing very well
that the humor of the great ones is always restless and unquiet
if their thoughts are not taken up about other business.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
As for the soldiers, lest idleness should effeminate them, he
kept them always employed about his works.</p>

<p>“Moreover, besides the pensions allowed them for life, he
also maintained them in the field, which kept them in submission
and dependence. As for kings, lords and governors,
he made frequent alterations and changes to break their
measures, and hinder them from growing popular. Above
all, he studied the humor and genius of his subjects; and if
any were found to be of a turbulent nature, he secured them,
and by that put them out of the possibility of revolt in his
absence.</p>

<p>“In fine, what rendered his government so peaceable,
was his immense treasures; for by these riches he bound all
his subjects tight to his interest, keeping all in hopes, though
he never intended them any favors. These were his principal
ways and means of maintaining peace in his governments.”</p>

<p>A very little consideration of the position in which Taikosama,
as ruler of Japan, was standing to these foreigners
must lead to the conclusion that he could take no other step
than that which he had taken. They had come to the country
uninvited. They had found the country in the possession,
so to speak, of a religion which had never shown a
persecuting spirit. They had come in their own vessels.
From the very outset they had displayed a hard, persecuting
spirit, with a tendency to re-embroil the country in war,
out of which it was only now emerging. They had insisted
on every one coming into subjection to them, with the alternative
of leaving house and home in case of refusal. They
were, as usual, now calling in the assistance of the temporal
power to force the yoke of their priestly supremacy on the
people of Japan. Had Taikosama been able to send them
away in vessels of the country, he would no doubt have done
so. But having no vessels, he gave them the alternative of
living peaceably in the country, or of leaving it. They
forced the ruling powers of Japan, by their encroachments
and persecuting system, to retaliate upon themselves, and
then gloried in considering themselves martyrs. They were,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
in short, constituting themselves and their flocks, over whom
they, as priests, had no political authority, an <i>imperium in
imperio</i>. They were teaching them to be rebels to their
own government, and the priests themselves were obliged
to end in the spirit in which they ought to have commenced—a
spirit of meekness among their enemies. It would seem,
from old as well as from recent experience, that, for Christians
to live among heathens, it is necessary to have an “exterritoriality”
power; but that is equivalent to saying simply
that the Christian power is the strongest, and it means
to enforce what it thinks right.</p>

<p>According to the resolutions of the meeting at Firando,
the Roman Catholics kept quiet and in retirement in the
several provinces in which they were settled.</p>

<p>The first of the line of Owotomo began as personal servant
of Yoritomo; and a portion of Satsuma’s territory was
given to him, after which the family rose to greatness during
the wars between the Emperors of the North and South.
About 1374 they acquired a large territory in the northeast
of the island of Kiusiu, covering the whole of Boongo
and parts of Boozen and the adjoining provinces—Tsikugo
and Tsikuzen. In the middle of the sixteenth century this
territory included nearly one-half of the island. The family
was ruined in the persecution of the Roman Catholics. The
principality of Arima covered, at one time, the greater part
of the province of Fizen. The territory, as was often the
case with small proprietors in feudal times, was at different
times enlarged and contracted. Latterly, it seems to have
included only the peninsula on which the town of Simabarra
stands, and but little more.</p>

<p>Omura is the name of a town which stands on the land-locked
bay of the same name, in the province of Fizen,
about twenty miles from Nagasaki; and the territory held
by the lord of that name included a strip of ground round
the city, and the greater part of the peninsula on which
Nagasaki stands. The family seems to have been an offshoot
from Arna, and never to have been of any great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
power until the rise of Nagasaki, which no sooner became
of any value than it was taken from the lord by Taikosama,
and has ever since remained government property.</p>

<p>The lord of Boongo, who had patronized the Jesuit
priests (“our Mæcenas,” as they call him), and afterward
had been converted and baptized, had died in the year 1587.
He had abdicated in favor of his son, but at one time resumed
the reins; but before his death had the pain of witnessing
the diminution of the family estates by powerful
and rapacious neighbors. His son, after losing part of his
estates and the favor of Taikosama, thought to regain both
by showing some activity in acting up to the recent proclamation.
He was the first to commence the persecution of
his father’s friends. Meantime, Taikosama returned to
Miako, and seems to have forgotten his edict and the
Christians altogether. Probably the truth is, that during
all this time, though he was annoyed by the Jesuits and
their proceedings, he was working out in his own mind
the means of making an attack upon China. He saw in
the foreign ships easy means of transport, and, knowing the
influence the priests exerted over the merchants, his hopes
lay in keeping in with the former to obtain the assistance of
the latter in his design. Some time after the promulgation
of the edict, he received most graciously Father Valignan,
Provincial of Japan and the Indies, as embassador from the
Viceroy of India, and as associate with the four young embassadors
who had returned from Europe.</p>

<p>The annexation of Nagasaki by government in 1590 was
a great blow to the Jesuits, inasmuch as it had been a source
of wealth, through the lord of Omura, who was a Christian;
and also, inasmuch as hitherto the governor had always been
a Christian, and he was now exchanged for two heathens.
The place had increased rapidly from the time the Jesuits
first went there, probably about 1575, when there were only
500 houses in the place, till 1590, when there were 5,000 families
resident, besides merchants and tradesmen who came
there in June from all parts on the arrival of the fleets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>In the year 1592, Taikosama carried out the project he
had long been thinking on, viz., the invasion of Corea and
thence of China, called in the letters “a foolish and temerarious
enterprise, infinitely hazardous, if not morally impracticable.”
It is difficult to see what motive existed for this
invasion. Being a man of war from his youth, and knowing
nothing else, he perhaps longed for new conquests. The
Jesuit writers attribute it to a wish to use up the Christians
in the island of Kiusiu, as well as to get rid of—Uriah-like—some
of the best generals of his army, who were believers
in the new doctrines. Another reason they give was his
wish to rival the greatest hero of the empire, now worshiped
as the god of war—Hatchimang—who had conquered
Corea through his mother. He made great preparations,
giving out that he was going to lead the army
himself. He handed over the power he held in Japan to
his nephew, Hidetsoongu, giving him, through the Emperor,
the title of Kwanbakku. He appointed four generals
of the army, two of whom were Christians, Don Austin and
Kahi no kami, son of Don Simon; the two other generals
were Toronosuqui and Aki no kami. Under the two former
were several Christian lords, Arima, Omura, Amacusa,
Boongo, Tsussima, Don Austin’s son-in-law, and others,
with an army of 40,000 men. The total number of men
collected, including seamen and tradesmen, was said to have
been 300,000, a large number to supply with food, and only
possible with an army fed nearly wholly upon rice. One-half
of the army, after a council of war, set sail from Nangoya
in Fizen, and was landed at Fusancay or Fkusan, at
the southern extremity of Corea. Don Austin commanded
this division. In no long time he repeatedly defeated the
Corean army and captured several fortresses. Taikosama
ordered Toronosuqui and his half of the army to follow into
Corea without delay. He came up to the support of Don
Austin, but, according to the Jesuits’ account, treacherously
held back his men that Don Austin might be defeated before
he came to his support. The Coreans seem to have shown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
no capacity for war, and in no long time nearly the whole
fortresses of the kingdom were in possession of the Japanese.</p>

<p>Taikosama, according to the Roman Catholic authorities,
still jealous of the body of Christians, especially after Don
Austin’s success, collected 150,000 men out of Kiusiu, and
sent them over to Corea, ordering the commander-in-chief
to return the vessels immediately in order that he might
follow in the spring. This is said to have been a ruse to
shut off their return.</p>

<p>Meantime the large force in Corea was being neglected;
they were left without provisions or ammunition. Their
men, deserting, were taken and killed, and at length Don
Austin was forced to fall back, and, after several engagements,
signed an agreement with the Coreans by which the
latter were to send two embassadors to Taikosama, and the
Japanese were to retire, and only to occupy twelve forts on
the sea-coast. The Japanese army was computed to have
lost 150,000 men. A truce was concluded, and embassadors
accompanied Don Austin to Japan. The following demands
were made: 1. That eight provinces of Corea be handed
over to Japan; 2. That the Emperor of China give one of
his daughters to Taikosama; 3. That there should be a free
trade between the two countries, and that China and Corea
should pay Japan a yearly tribute.</p>

<p>In 1592, Lupus di Liano, a Spanish envoy, was dispatched
from Manila to lay complaints against the Portuguese
before Taikosama. He was lost on his return with
the vessel in which he sailed.</p>

<p>In 1593 the governor of the Philippines sent over another
envoy. He took over with him four religious Recollects of
St. Francis. These were the first arrivals in Japan of any
other order not of the Jesuit, with the exception of one
Dominican, who accompanied the previous Spanish envoy.
Among the presents was a Spanish horse richly harnessed.
Among the presents brought by Father Valignan had been
an Arab horse. The blood of these presents has probably
influenced the breed in Japan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>At an interview with Taikosama these Franciscans asked
to see his palace. “With all my heart, provided you do not
preach in my states.” The religious, being resolved not
to obey him, gave no promise, but made a low reverence.
Shortly after, the governor of Miako sent to the Jesuit fathers
to tell them to go on with their work of piety, but
with privacy and prudence. In consequence of this they
hired a house and met privately, none appearing in public
except two. “But the fathers of St. Francis thought not
themselves obliged to such condescendence. Their ardent
zeal made them believe that such deference to the order of
the sovereign was contrary to the liberty of the Gospel, and
that they ought to preach the faith despite of all laws to the
contrary.” They went to Taikosama and asked for some
place away from secular people to build a little house for
their own private convenience. He did not carry his edict
into execution against them, but referred them to the
governor of Miako, who assigned “them a very sweet seat
without the walls of Miako, commanding that they should
neither preach nor hold assemblies of Christians, according
to Taikosama’s orders. But the fathers, without regard to
either the governor’s advice or Taikosama’s orders, built
immediately both a church and a convent with a wall about
it. Even the wise and more prudent among the Christians
advised them to be seriously careful of what they were doing.
The governor, hearing of it, sent and requested them to shut
up their church.” He was obliged to inform Taikosama,
saying, “He feared that these religious, who call themselves
embassadors from the Philippines, intend to preach like the
rest.” “They won’t,” replied he, in a passion, “if they be
wise; for if they do, I’ll teach them to laugh at me.”</p>

<p>These Franciscans, thinking they were most successful,
wrote to Manila for others to come over to assist them.
They opened a church at Osaka, and designed to erect a
third at Nagasaki. To this end they desired the governor
would obtain leave of Taikosama for two sick to change air.
The governor said in case of health they were free to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
where they pleased. Upon this two went to Nagasaki, and
began to say mass and preach publicly without any regard
to the Emperor’s mandates.</p>

<p>The Jesuits were much surprised that these Franciscan
fathers should fix a residence in their jurisdiction without
their consent; while the lieutenant-governor, having received
strict orders not to permit any service in the town,
was in doubts what to do. He referred to the governor,
and he, being alarmed for himself, ordered a note to be
taken of every one who disobeyed the law, but said he
would apply for further instructions to Taikosama himself.
Hearing from Miako that these men had asked and received
permission to go to Nagasaki on the plea of sickness only, he
ordered them out of his jurisdiction, which seems to be a
very lenient course of treatment, considering the trouble
that had already arisen out of this preaching.</p>

<p>The success of Konishi (Don Austin) in Corea seems at
first to have operated in his favor. Taikosama was delighted;
but as soon as this first feeling was over, alarm
at thinking he was a Christian, and as such could command
the services of a very large body of his countrymen
at a word from the Jesuit priests, seems to have been the
most prominent feeling in his mind. He knew by experience
that the Buddhist priests had been able to keep the
armies of Nobu nanga at bay for several years. He therefore
dissembled, and in the meantime he recalled Justo to
court, and gave him a large pension.</p>

<p>At this time, however, another circumstance occurred
which occupied his mind for a time. Hidetsoongu, his
nephew, had been acknowledged as heir, and power was
delegated to him as regent while Taiko should be away in
Corea. Of this young man a somewhat extraordinary account
is given in the Jesuit letters. In 1587, when Taiko
chose to make a great show of favor to the Roman Catholics
and the missionaries, the fathers were taken up continually
with preaching, baptizing and instructing such of the
principal lords as desired earnestly this sacrament, among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
whom was Taiko’s own nephew, and presumptive heir to
the crown.</p>

<p>“Hidetsoongu was a young man of three-and-thirty years
of age, endowed with all the qualifications that can be desired
in a young prince. He had a quick and penetrating
wit, an excellent judgment, and withal a most courteous
and obliging behavior. He was wise, prudent and discreet.
He abhorred the vices of his country and loved learning, and
took pleasure in it. For this reason he was delighted in the
company of the fathers, and knowing that our religion set
value on virtue and good manners, he took a particular
affection to it.</p>

<p>“But all these good qualities were quite obscured by a
strange and most inhuman vice. He took a strange kind of
pleasure and diversion in killing men, insomuch that when
any one was condemned to die, he chose to be executioner
himself. He walled in a place near his palace, and set in
the middle a sort of table for the criminal to lie on till he
hewed him to pieces. Sometimes, also, he took them standing,
and split them in two. But his greatest satisfaction
was to cut them off limb by limb, which he did as exactly
as one can take off the leg or wing of a fowl. Sometimes,
also, he set them up for a mark, and shot at them with pistols
and arrows. But what is most horrid of all, he used to
rip up women with child to see how the infants lay in their
mother’s womb. Father Froes, who had seen and conversed
with him, describes him as you have seen.” This account is
corroborated by native history.</p>

<p>For many years Hidetsoongu had been looked upon as
his uncle’s heir. He had three children; but about this time
one of Taiko’s wives had a son, who was thought by many
to be supposititious. “Be it as it will,” write the fathers,
“he made great rejoicing for it all over Japan, and insisted
on his nephew adopting the child as his son.”</p>

<p>The consequence was that uncle and nephew became
jealous and distrustful each of the other. In the “History
of the Church” a full account is given of their meetings in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
Miako. “Taikosama sent to his nephew to say he would
invest him with full power. Hidetsoongu prepared a magnificent
feast. The day was settled, but the uncle was
afraid to trust himself within the palace of Juraku, where
the nephew was waiting for him. At last he was persuaded
to go, and went with great magnificence in a triumphal
chariot (a closed box) all laid with gold, drawn by
two large oxen with gilt horns. The procession lasted from
morning till two in the afternoon. All this time Taiko
minded more the security of his own person than all the
entertainments. He placed guards all about his apartments,
and advised his nephew to lodge in another palace. The
nobility generally believed that Hidetsoongu would never
let slip so fair an opportunity of avenging the injuries he
had received, and therefore every one took care of himself.
But no attempt was made on Taiko’s life. Appearances
were kept up for some days; but the nephew, disgusted
with his uncle’s treatment, secretly began to make the preparations
which had been expected of him long before.” But
he was betrayed by the first of the nobles to whom he applied—probably
Mowori (known as Choshiu), who gave
Taiko information. In no long time Taiko brought the
matter to a point by asking explicit answers to plain questions,
and in the meantime collected troops about Miako.
When he thought he was safe, he sent to his nephew and
ordered him off instanter to his father’s territory. He was
then ordered to enter the monastery of Koga, used as a retreat
by exiled nobles. He marched, accordingly, all night.
The prisoner was treated as badly as possible; and in August,
1795, an order came from his uncle that he and his
servants should rip themselves up. Hidetsoongu paid the
last attention one friend can pay to another in Japan, and
cut their heads off after they had stabbed themselves. He
himself repeatedly stabbed himself, and one of his esquires
took his master’s saber and cut off his head, and then stabbing
himself, fell on his body. Father Froes seems to have
been on the spot at the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>Taikosama, in the whole of this affair, showed a spirit of
extreme cruelty and vindictiveness. He, not satisfied with
the life of his nephew, put to death all his friends, and then,
collecting his family, sent his wives and children, the eldest
five years of age, his own grand nephews and nieces, to execution;
with savage atrocity sending for his nephew’s head
that it might be shown to them at the scaffold. They were
all beheaded to the number of thirty-one ladies and three
children, and their bodies thrown into a hole in Sanjio Street,
over which a sort of erection or tomb was built, and on it the
inscription, Tchikushozuka, “The tomb of bitches,” which
remains to this day. A temple has been built close by, and
is named Tchikushozuka no dera.</p>

<p>Taikosama had long set his heart upon the hope of prevailing
upon the Emperor of China to send an embassy to
Japan, and, to his own surprise, his ambition was gratified.
Don Austin, according to Jesuit accounts, by working upon
the fears of the officers of the Celestial court, induced them
to send two men to Corea, who were ordered to pass over
into Japan. Taikosama made preparations to receive this
embassy with great magnificence, but in the end treated the
envoys with marked insolence and rudeness.</p>

<p>In August of 1596 a comet was visible for fifteen days in
Japan, and on the 30th of the same month a frightful earthquake
is recorded to have occurred. By this the greater part
of the buildings recently erected at great expense at Osaka
and Fusimi were completely demolished. Recurring at midnight
of the 1st of September with awful violence, all the
magnificent buildings raised by the Taiko were in a moment
thrown down—two lofty eight-storied buildings, visited by
the fathers, being destroyed. Stones, each of which had required
the united efforts of 1,500 men to put in their places,
were hurled out. The heavy roofs of temples and buildings,
subsiding <i>en masse</i>, buried many under them, and, as usual
in Japan, the fires which arose carried death to those buried
under the wood. The occasion is used by one of the fathers,
in his letter, to indulge in a sneer against the Buddhist priesthood.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
In doing so, he gives some insight into the tenets inculcated
in their sermons by these Buddhist priests. “He
was preaching on the evening prior to the earthquake with
such a torrent of eloquence as to bear all before him, and
the main drift of his discourse was the mercy and bounty of
his god toward his clients, particularly at the hour of death.
He enlarged upon his charity to mankind, showing that he
would have all men to be saved, without distinction or exception
of persons, exhorting them to cast themselves on his
mercy. So soon as he had made an end of speaking, the
people cried out with a general voice, ‘Our god, be merciful
to us!’ But Amida was probably asleep, for that very night
the temple fell to the ground, the idol was broken, and the
preacher narrowly escaped with his life.” By this convulsion
the immense copper figure of Buddha at Miako was
broken. The Jesuit accounts state that seventy women
about the palace at Fusimi were killed, the Taiko himself
narrowly escaping to a mountain top, where he dwelt in a
reed hut, for fear of being swallowed up in the chasms of
the earth. Saccay, the richest and most voluptuous city of
Japan, suffered, at the same time, greatly from one of those
fearful incursions of the sea consequent upon a temporary
depression or bending downward of the crust of the earth.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Taikosama’s passion began to cool, and
the fathers “had grounds to hope that religion would be re-established,
as he was rather pleased at their obeying his
edict, and keeping quiet in deference to his wishes.” He
still took pleasure in occasionally receiving the bishop, and
winked at the fathers remaining in the capital. But when
everything was again promising of fair wind, another storm
arose, and again the origin is attributed by the Jesuits, not
to the Japanese, but to the same Franciscan fathers who
had recently arrived from Manila. The Jesuits’ letters say,
“The Recollects of the regular observance of St. Francis,
who were lately settled at Miako, being now conversant in
the language of the country, began to preach publicly in the
churches, to hear confessions and baptize the infidels, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
any regard to the Emperor’s orders. Had religion been
on the same footing as heretofore, the zeal and labor of these
holy men would have wrought wonders, but the design was
so ill-concerted at this juncture, that, instead of reaping any
advantage by it, as was expected, it drew a bloody persecution
both upon themselves and the other Christians. For
being newly established in Japan, little acquainted with the
genius of the people, and less with Taikosama’s designs,
they gave full scope to their zeal without regard to the Emperor’s
threats, or even to the advice of their friends, who
counseled them all along to act in concert with the other
religious, who by their prudence and wise conduct had
counted so many thousands of souls in this mission. But
nothing was able to stop this torrent of zeal. Designing
well, they believed themselves obliged to overlook all human
respects, and this persuasion made them jealous of friends’
advice as savoring of jealousy and envy. The Christians,
not at all satisfied with their conduct, begged of them to
moderate their zeal; but being men that undervalued their
lives, and in a persuasion that the Emperor would never
offer any rudeness to persons of their character that bore
the name of embassadors from one of the greatest monarchs
of the world, they continued their functions with new fervor
and zeal. The natives said, ‘These men neither regard our
counsel nor the Emperor’s orders, but one day they’ll
repent it.’”</p>

<p>But still, notwithstanding these infractions of the recently
published edict, there was no ill-will shown to these men.
Four new governors of state had been appointed. These
governors, hearing of the friars’ rashness, sent to them privately
to admonish them of their danger, telling them that
if it came to Taiko’s ears he would certainly put them all to
death. This information only added new life and vigor to
their zeal, so desirous were they of suffering martyrdom for
Christ. The viceroy sent for two of these friars to the palace,
and reprimanded them severely for slighting the Emperor’s
desires. This notwithstanding, they went on with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
their functions. The superior of the Jesuits, F. Organtin,
hearing of those complaints by the governor, as well as the
Christians and heathens, sent to Friar Baptist to lay before
him the danger himself and his family, as well as the whole
Church of Japan, was in if he did not (so far as reason, conscience
and zeal of God’s glory would permit) study to give
the governor satisfaction, and yield a little to the times.
“I do not find,” says the writer, “what answer was given,
but this is certain, they both preached and administered the
sacraments after that more publicly than before.”</p>

<p>These men, under the quality of embassadors, had come
to the country, and under the same name were remaining in
Japan to insult the supreme power, and to irritate the government
into taking the only means in its power of supporting
its own dignity; viz., putting them out of the way.
“Guenifoin” (probably Kio no kami, or governor of Miako),
“who had all along favored the Christians, foreseeing the
ill-consequences of this refractory humor, suspended still
the execution of his threats, and did not so much as hint at
it either to the court. However, the business was discovered
at last, and the friars were betrayed by their friend
Faranda, the person who invited them over from the Philippines.”
They intrigued with this man, who seems to have
used his knowledge of the Spanish language and his acquaintance
with the Roman fathers of the Church for his
own advancement. “At first they had some difficulty in
accepting his invitation (in the name of Taikosama) to visit
Japan, as contrary to the decree of Gregory XIII. forbidding
all priests (the Society excepted) to preach in Japan.
All the able men whom they consulted agreed that embassadors
were not included in this decree; and Sextus Quintus
having given leave to the religious of St. Francis to preach
the Gospel through the East Indies, the islands of Japan
fell in course as part of the whole.”</p>

<p>The conduct of these men would in any country have exposed
them to the notice of the government. There is little
need for drawing into the question of the treatment of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
embassadorial fathers the conduct of the captain of a rich
Spanish galleon wrecked upon the southern coast of Sikok.
This man lost his ship, and the treasures were seized by
Taikosama. “Upon being examined, he pointed out on a
map the territories belonging to the King of Spain, and
added that the way in which he obtained such extensive
possessions was by first sending missionaries; and so soon
as they had gained a sufficient number of proselytes, the
King followed with his troops, and, joining the new converts,
made a conquest of the kingdoms.”</p>

<p>Upon the conduct of these Franciscan fathers being
brought to the notice of Taikosama, he at once ordered
them to be executed. At first the Jesuits thought that all
Christians were included in this order; but the Giboo no
sho wrote to Nagasaki to the governor, in the name of Taikosama,
to see that no affront was offered to the Jesuits,
whom he was pleased to have reside there on condition that
they did not preach, or baptize, or hold assemblies.</p>

<p>The Father Provincial of the Jesuits, considering this condition
opposed to the law of God, resolved to take no notice
of it, but wrote to those under him to extend the empire of
Christ, but still by such ways and means as might not give
the Emperor cause of complaint. These five Franciscans
were sent down from Miako to Nagasaki to be there executed,
under the following sentence:</p>

<p>“Seeing that these men have come from the Philippine
Islands in the quality of embassadors, yet have continued
residing at Miako to spread the Christian law, which I some
years ago prohibited, I command that all of them, together
with those Japanese who have enrolled themselves under
this law, be arrested, and let the whole twenty-four undergo
the punishment of the cross at Nagasaki. And once more
I prohibit the foresaid doctrine in time to come. Let all
know this, and, further, that it be carried into execution.
But if any one will not obey my edict, he, with all his family,
shall be punished.”</p>

<p>The punishment of the cross is inflicted by tying the criminal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
to a cross and transfixing the lungs and heart with two
sharp spears. The twenty-four were thus executed at Nagasaki
on February 5, 1597. The religious of St. Francis,
together with the three Jesuits, were all placed in the Catalogue
of Saints by Urban VIII., in the year 1627.</p>

<p>These men were punished by the Taiko not on account
of their religion, but as contumelious persons, defying his
laws. He appreciated the benefits of foreign trade, he valued
the presents brought to him, and he admired the learning of
the Jesuits; but he now saw a new doctrine being adopted
by his subjects which would tolerate no other near it. The
followers of this doctrine were becoming a great political
power in the state, and more particularly in Simo or Kiusiu.
Several of his principal military officers adhered to this new
sect. Some of the highest nobles in the land had, according
to the accounts of the Jesuits, favored it. The bishop, to
whom no doubt extraordinary external reverence would be
shown by the Roman Catholics, was an occasional visitor at
Taikosama’s court. F. Rodriguez was apparently in constant
attendance as interpreter. The desire to continue to
participate in the advantages of foreign trade was being
counterbalanced by the probable dangers of the ascendency
of such a power in the state, and Taikosama was becoming
alarmed. There was a strong party opposed to the Roman
Catholics—those who had been expelled from their lands, or
who had been obliged to conform to retain them; those who
were envious or jealous of the rise of such men as Konishi
from a comparatively low position to a high military command;
the priests, whose flocks were being withdrawn, and
their incomes thereby diminished; and all that numerous
class whose interests are on the side of things remaining as
they are—all these were pressing that something should be
done to overthrow the political structure which these foreigners
were attempting to raise.</p>

<p>During the life of Taikosama these men, with their native
associates, were the only sufferers for disobedience to his edict.</p>

<p>While Taikosama seemed every day becoming more timid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
and afraid of what steps might be taken by the Christian
party, an embassy arrived from Manila, to whose demand
he replied that “he put to death the Franciscans because
they preached the Christian religion in his empire contrary
to his express command.” But he did not pursue his harsh
measures any further. He wished to get rid of such disturbers
of the empire; and “hearing that Spain and Portugal
were now under one prince, he became jealous to the last
degree that the Jesuits of these two nations concerted together,
under the color of religion, to bring Japan under the
same yoke.” He determined, therefore, while all the Christian
princes were in Corea, to send away by ship all the foreign
priests. But still he allowed a few to remain in Nagasaki,
on condition that they did not stir out of town, nor
preach.</p>

<p>He ordered Terasawa, governor of Nagasaki, to assemble
all the Jesuits and ship them off by the first convenience to
China. This, in truth, seems to have been the only resource
left to him if he wished to retain the government of the country,
or to preserve it from once more undergoing all the horrors
of a civil war. If he had heard of the doings of Philip
II. in the Netherlands during the few years since the first
arrival of these foreign priests in Japan, he might have
learned lessons of more decided measures for refractory subjects,
and have carried out his wishes in ridding Japan of
them by a more summary method of persecution.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1598 Taikosama was attacked by
dysentery, and was so ill that his life was despaired of. His
son (real or supposed) was then about six years of age. He
saw that, in all probability, the power, after leaving his own
hands, would fall into those of Iyeyas, now ruler of the eight
provinces around Yedo. He therefore determined to strike
up a family alliance between his son and the granddaughter
of Iyeyas, thinking he would thereby induce the latter to
throw his whole weight into the scale on behalf of his own
grandchild and her husband, and that thus the power would
descend to his own family. The marriage was immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
celebrated; and Iyeyas swore that he would turn the government
over to Taiko’s son so soon as he was able to rule by
himself. Still further to strengthen the party of his son, he
appointed five governors of the country (as Gotairo), and
four others, to be about the boy, with instructions to obey
Iyeyas, to acknowledge his son as sovereign so soon as he
came of age, to continue all the lords in their places as he
had appointed, and to oppose all innovations on the laws
now established. To strengthen the position of his son still
further, he appointed boards of officers, Tchiuro and Goboonyo,
or five rulers.</p>

<p>On his deathbed, such little animosity as he may have
had toward the foreign priests seems to have been mitigated,
as he sent for, or allowed, Father Rodriguez to visit
him, when he thanked the father for the trouble he had taken
in visiting him in health as well as in sickness.</p>

<p>A temporary amendment enabled him to rouse himself,
when his chief thoughts ran upon strengthening the citadel
of Osaka, where 17,000 houses were pulled down to build the
wall, which was a league in circuit. He only survived a few
days, dying upon September 15, 1598; all his nobility, according
to the fathers, “being much better pleased to see
him on the list of dead gods than in the land of living men.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>GOVERNMENT OF IYEYAS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the removal of Taikosama, the hopes of the Roman
Catholic party revived.</p>

<p>Once more the keystone of the arch was removed, and
the ordinary institutions of the country were found unequal
to the crisis.</p>

<p>The deceased ruler had foreseen this, and had made such
arrangements as he could to strengthen the position of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
young son. He foresaw that Iyeyas was the man of the
future; the man most fitted by talent, military capacity, and
position to take the reins. He therefore tried to bind him
by ties of marriage, as well as by oaths, to support the youthful
inheritor of power. He had, as one of his methods of
governing, induced or compelled the nobles to lavish large
sums of money in presents to himself, in keeping up large
retinues, in making expensive journeys between their country
residences and the capital, and in building palaces in the
two cities of Osaka and Fusimi. By these means the nobles
were impoverished. They could not afford to keep many
armed followers. Mowori of Nagato had been lately compelled
to give up some of his territories, and to pay his respects
at the court. Satsuma had suffered during the recent
wars in Kiusiu. Iyeyas alone had kept aloof from Taikosama.
He had kept his court and established himself at
Yedo, where he was allowed to remain undisturbed, an object
of jealousy as well as of fear. Still he seems to have been
occasionally about the court of Taikosama, as he is mentioned
in one of the letters as being present at the meeting
of Taiko and his nephew. He perhaps kept Taikosama’s
mother still as a hostage in Yedo. Each of these potentates,
in all probability, knew and read the other’s thoughts—each
thinking that the territories and the position of both would
fall into the hands of the longest liver. The most dissembling
are often the most credulous, and Taikosama was catching
at a straw when he summoned Iyeyas to his deathbed.
Iyeyas had refused to visit him on a former occasion without
a hostage in the person of his mother. On this occasion
he came, but, no doubt, with sufficient precautions. He saw
that a political crisis was impending, and he knew that the
fruit he had long waited for was falling into his hands.
There was little reason now why he should not seize it.</p>

<p>The only persons who seem not to have descried the
change that was at hand were the Roman Catholic fathers.
By their own letters they do not appear to have paid any
court to the sun rising in the east. No missions are mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
to Yedo, or in the Kwanto; no interpreter is sent to
the court of Iyeyas; no conversions are spoken of there as
in Miako and the west; and no priests were located there,
who might have been acceptable if they had been able to
speak in the dialect of the eastern provinces. The Jesuit
fathers, up to this time, had rarely mentioned any of the
provinces east of Mino or Owarri.</p>

<p>The Taiko had put to death his nephew, who was of an
age fit to have held the reins after his departure. He left,
as successor, Hideyori, a child of six years of age. The general
belief was that this child was not the son of Taiko, but
he himself appears to have firmly regarded him as such.
Recollecting his own origin and rise to the pinnacle of power,
and knowing the turbulent spirits among the lords, his countrymen,
whom he had all his life long been trying to curb,
it is little wonder that he felt uneasy at the prospect opening
up to this child.</p>

<p>The Jesuits of this time write: “As to religion, there were
all the grounds in the world to believe it in a fair way of
being established in Japan. So many potent kings and general
officers being all Christians at the head of a victorious
army, and masters of Simo (Kiusiu), where the inhabitants
had all embraced the faith, it was only prudence in the regents
(the Gotairo), who were divided among themselves,
to keep fair with them. Above all, Samburandono (Sanhoshi),
grandson and heir of Nobu nanga, having lately
professed himself a Christian, it was probable the Christians
and malcontents would join in these divisions, and put him
in possession of his ancient rights, which the late Taikosama
had unjustly usurped. The faithful began to breathe
after the tyrant’s death.”</p>

<p>Probably the conversion of Sanhoshi (if true) to the Christian
side blinded these fathers to the weakness of his claims,
and to the weight, power, and talents of Iyeyas. The claims
of Sanhoshi and Hideyori were equally weak. Both were the
heirs of men who had risen from comparatively low rank
and seized the coveted position, which had been hereditary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
in the families of their predecessors, but which, having been
held by these men, their fathers, respectively one after the
other, could not be said to be in their families hereditary.</p>

<p>The first step taken by the Gotairo, or five governors appointed
by Taikosama before his death, who now assumed
the power in the name of Hideyori, was the recall of the
army from Corea, showing how much the whole expedition
depended upon the will of the one man, and with how little
favor it was regarded by the people of Japan. This brought
back to the island of Kiusiu a strong re-enforcement of Christians
with Don Austin at their head; and his bitter foe, Toronosuqui,
the strong opponent of the Roman Catholic party.</p>

<p>In the letters written by the Jesuits at this period, the
Taiko had generally been spoken of as the Emperor, and
very rarely is any notice taken of the real Emperor, then
living at Miako. Still less notice is accorded to the Shiogoon,
Yoshitaru, who was then living at Miako, and holding
the highest hereditary office that could be held by a subject.
He was of the Ashikanga family, and, so long as he lived,
neither Nobu nanga nor Taikosama could hold this office.
In 1597 he died, and the office, which in the family had become
an empty title, was not conferred on any of his relations.
The family is still represented by individuals at Miako,
who, though receiving some privileges, live in poverty and
obscurity. The death of this man, and the cessation of the
hereditary claim to the office, opportunely opened to Iyeyas
the prospect of combining once more the chief power with
the highest hereditary office in the state.</p>

<p>The year 1599 is given, in the native annals, as the first
year in which the English and Dutch ships visited Japan
(they are said to have come to the town of Saccay, near
Osaka). Dutch pilots had been navigating those seas during
several years past; some of the accounts given by
Linschoten being the results of observations by Dutchmen.
William Adams, the English pilot of the Dutch
fleet of five sail, which left the Texel on June 24, 1598,
did not reach Boongo till April, 1600, with only nine or ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
men surviving out of the crew, and these nearly worn out
with scurvy and privations. He was taken to Osaka, where
he had an interview with Iyeyas, who was much pleased
with him; but the jealousy of the Portuguese was roused,
and they tried to instill into the ears of those to whom they
had access malicious reports against these newcomers.</p>

<p>Meantime, it was impossible that affairs should continue
long peaceably on the present critical footing. The Jesuits,
however, were elated with the appearance of things. “(Gieiaso)
Iyeyas ko,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> now called Daifusama” (another name for
Nai dai jin), “spoke favorably of religion, giving them leave
to exercise their religion at Nagasaki, so that every one
thought the Society re-established in the exercise of her
functions.</p>

<p>“However, it was not long before the governors fell at
variance among themselves—Jiboo no sho and Asano dan jo
in the first place. The grudge between them was of an early
date, but the office now held by both induced them to come to
a kind of agreement. A like dissension happened among the
lieutenant-generals in Corea about the late treaty of peace,
and the differences ran so high that each took opposite sides
on their return home—Don Austin and his followers with
Jiboo no sho, and the rest with Asano dan jo. Several of
the lords and Daifusama himself labored hard to compose
the difference, and at last sentence was given in favor of
Jiboo no sho and his party. Asano resolved to right himself
by the sword, and in a short time many lords came over
to his party. Don Austin, with Arima, Omura, Satsuma,
Tchikugo, and Terazawa, stuck close to the interest of
Jiboo no sho. But what set the whole kingdom in a flame
was a misunderstanding between Jiboo no sho and Daifusama,
the regent of the empire. The former charged Iyeyas
with assuming an air of authority, and with secret practices,
as if he intended to make himself master of the imperial domain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
Iyeyas answered these complaints of the governors
with a great deal of modesty and calmness, and, in the main,
gave a fair account of his conduct. But finding that his opponents
were levying troops, he gathered an army of 30,000
men out of his own states to prevent a surprise.</p>

<p>“The nobility were then all at court, part at Fusimi and
part at Osaka, about the young prince. But seeing war declared
between Jiboo no sho and the regent, every one armed
himself and his followers, until they reckoned in the two
towns 200,000 combatants, besides inhabitants. The streets
swarmed with soldiers, and nothing was looked for but a
grand massacre. But it being enacted that whoever first
broke the peace should be declared an enemy to the state,
it was each one’s business to keep from hostilities. In this
manner they continued for some months in the same town,
and not a stroke on either side. At last Daifusama being
much superior to his adversary (whom most deserted to serve
the regent), he sent to him to rip up his belly for the public
good.</p>

<p>“Don Austin, who joined interest with Jiboo no sho (otherwise
Ishida mitzu nari), knew very well that would not
serve Daifusama’s turn, unless, at the same time, he could
involve the rest of his party in the same ruin. In the meantime,
Daifusama seized on the castle of Osaka with the young
prince so suddenly that neither the garrison, nor Jiboo no
sho, who lived hard by, had time to put themselves in a
posture of defense. This was a thunderbolt to the latter,
who fled to Fusimi, to the governors, where he was joined
by Don Austin. Daifusama pursued them, and a temporary
peace was struck up, on condition that Jiboo no sho
gave up his commission and retired to his residence in the
province of Omi. He took a son of Daifusama’s with him
as hostage.”</p>

<p>After this, Iyeyas was supreme, the governors continuing
to retain their empty titles. The Roman Catholics applied
to Iyeyas, who received them so kindly that they were
generally of a persuasion that he intended to restore the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
churches and permit the fathers to preach the Gospel, “so
very easy are we to believe what we have a mind should
happen.”</p>

<p>However, at this moment they were annoyed by the lord
of Firado showing symptoms of intolerance, for in one night
six hundred Christians left the island and came to Nagasaki,
contrary to the laws and edicts of Taikosama. The province
of Higo, in the island of Kiusiu, was now under the rule of
Don Austin, and by his orders the inhabitants were being
converted or coerced into Christianity.</p>

<p>At this juncture the Emperor was a mere shadow. The
power had fallen nominally into the hands of a boy. The
scepter, or seat of power, was at the disposal of the most
powerful. The respect for, or fears of, the lately deceased
ruler had not died out; and the carrying out of his wishes,
and the establishment of this boy in his place, was the alleged
intention of each of the contending parties. The one
party was made up of those chiefs or lords who had been
about Taikosama during his life, and had been appointed to
high offices under him, such as the five governors or regents
for his son. To these were added those who had been engaged
as commanders in the Corean wars, of whom Satsuma
and Konishi were the ablest and most powerful, the latter
being looked upon as the greatest soldier of his day.</p>

<p>On the other side, Iyeyas had evidently determined that
the boy, now his grandson by marriage, should not stand in
the way of his own advancement to power and position, and
that he should be made the ladder by which he might reach
his object.</p>

<p>The empire again resounded with the preparations for
war. “Daifusama was grown so absolute since the late
troubles at Osaka and Menco that he acted and did all by
himself, none daring so much as dispute his commands.
This sore perplexed the governors and mortified them to
the quick; however, as soon as Jiboo no sho was retired [to
his castle of Sawoyama, by orders of Iyeyas], they all returned
back to Osaka and Fusimi, Cangerafu only excepted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
who pretended a grant from Taikosama to live three years
in his own states.” This was probably Ooyay soongi kange
katzu of Etsingo, one of the wealthiest and most powerful
of the lords, and to him Iyeyas sent orders to repair immediately
to the young prince on pain of being prosecuted as
an enemy to the state. The confederates were trying to
divide the forces of their opponent, and to gain by stratagem
what he was beginning to feel himself able to obtain by the
open assertion and display of power. He had possession of
the castle of Osaka and of the town of Fusimi. In the latter
he left his son with a garrison. The confederate lords hoped
to seize those places so soon as Iyeyas left them. Letters
were dispatched to Jiboo no sho and to Konishi, who immediately
joined the league, “having no other intention but to
keep their promise with Taikosama, and to preserve the crown
for the young prince.” They tried to draw over the head
officers of “Daifusama’s army; and all things being in readiness,
they wheeled round upon Osaka, and so secured most
of the nobility to their party. The governors, flushed with
their success, sent a manifesto to Daifusama, with heavy
complaints of his conduct. They commanded him to return
to Quanto, and positively forbade him the court.”</p>

<p>The governors at the same time ordered all persons in his
army to return to their posts or homes on the penalty of punishment
falling on their relatives and property. This order
brought about the death of a Christian lady, Grace, wife of
Itowo Tango no kami, one of the commanders in the army
of Iyeyas, of whom the Jesuits speak as a miracle of beauty
and piety. Her husband having joined the army of Iyeyas,
left command with his servants that, in case of any such
order being issued and put in force, they were to cut off his
wife’s head. His orders were obeyed. His chief servant
informed his mistress, with tears in his eyes, of his master’s
orders. He, falling on his knees, begged pardon for what
he was about to do, promising to revenge her by his and his
fellow-servant’s suicide. With one blow he cut off her head,
and, thinking it indecent to die in the same room as their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
mistress, they retired to another, where they cut open their
bellies, while one of them set fire to the powder, and blew
up the part of the palace in which they were lying.</p>

<p>The army of the league now numbered 100,000 men. The
chiefs determined to attack the citadel of Fusimi. They contrived
to set it on fire, and in a few hours was consumed “this
splendid and last monument of Taikosama’s greatness, the
richest and noblest palace in all Japan.” After this they
felt themselves strong enough to take the field, and hazard
a battle, if necessary, which should decide the fate of parties.
“There was this difference betwixt the regent’s and
the governors’ troops: The first, being under one supreme
head, acted vigorously and with unanimous consent; whereas
the other, depending on several masters, and having each
separate interests, the whole time was spent in marches and
countermarches to no manner of purpose.”</p>

<p>Iyeyas laid siege to Gifoo, the fortress of Hide nobu or
Saburo dono, the nephew of Nobu nanga, in the province
of Mino. By a stratagem and ambuscade he routed the
army, completely destroying it, and entered and seized the
castle, taking prisoner Hide nobu. He then turned back
westward to meet the army of the governors, which was
lying on the west of the plain and village of Sekingaharra.
The army of his opponents had been re-enforced by the
troops of Satsuma and of Konishi. This plain is to the east
side of the hills which form the east wall of the Lake of
Owomi. One hill of this ridge, Ee buki yama, is still noted
for the foreign plants which grow upon its sides, the result
or remains of the labors of the Portuguese missionaries who
had a residence upon the hill. From this hill flows to the
east the waters of the Kisso gawa. One of the main roads
of Japan, the Naka sen do, passes through this plain from
east to west, and at the village of Sekingaharra another road
crosses the former from the northwest. Here on this plain
the two armies met; but before the most decisive battle in
Japanese history was fought they lay thirty days facing one
another, “and durst not strike a stroke.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>The army of the league numbered 80,000 men, while that
of Iyeyas could only muster 50,000. Each party had been
engaged in trying to gain over some of their opponents before
trusting to the fate of war. Iyeyas had been delayed
by his enemies in the eastern provinces; but hearing of the
position of affairs at Sekingaharra, he marched rapidly up,
and in October, 1600, joined his army with a considerable
re-enforcement of troops. His motions were so rapid and
so secret that his opponents were not aware of his being in
the province. The following day he commenced an attack
upon the army of the governors, commanded by Jiboo no
sho and Don Austin. “No sooner had the armies begun
to move than several of the general officers, with the troops
under their command, marched straight over to the side of
Iyeyas, which put the rest of the army in such consternation
that, instead of fighting, they turned tail and fled without
looking behind them. Daifusama, perceiving them in disorder,
gave word for his men to advance; and making his
way through the lines, which made very little opposition,
gained a complete victory almost without the trouble of
striking a blow for it. None besides the general officers
and some of the leading men had the courage to face the
enemy at the first onset. These partly dispatched themselves,
partly were killed by the enemy, and partly were
taken prisoners. Among these latter was the celebrated
Don Austin. This great hero, seeing his men in a rout,
and no possibility of rallying again, threw himself into the
midst of the enemy’s troops, slaying on every side, and bearing
all down before him, till, wounded from head to foot,
and overpowered by numbers, he was forced to yield to fate
and surrender himself prisoner, together with Jiboo no sho,
who had not the heart (as he confessed himself afterward)
to open his belly after the example of the worthies above
mentioned.</p>

<p>“As for Don Austin, nothing but conscience could possibly
have hindered him from such an attempt; and therefore
choosing, as he did, to pass for heartless and a coward, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
to expose himself to an ignominious death rather than offend
God, was an action of the first rate, worthy to be found upon
the roll in the history of his other heroical exploits.” The
native account would make out that Don Austin attempted
to escape from the field of battle, taking the road leading to
the residence of the Roman Catholic priests on the hill of
Ee buki yama, but was taken prisoner before reaching a
place of safety.</p>

<p>The immediate result of this very decisive victory was
to blow to the winds the rope of sand which his enemies had
been endeavoring to coil round Iyeyas. His opponents were
scattered and their hands paralyzed. Iyeyas was master of
the situation. He lost no time in marching westward to
gain possession of Osaka. He seized Sawoyama, a castle
then belonging to Jiboo no sho, and now known as Hikonay,
the residence of Ee kamong no kami. The brother of
the proprietor was in command of the place. He put to
death all the women and children, and set fire to the house,
to take from the enemy the honor of leading him in triumph.
Mowori was in command at Osaka, and, as ruler over ten
provinces, he was now the only chief who was likely to dispute
with Iyeyas the position of regent. But he was panic-struck,
and, though at the head of 40,000 men, gave up the
place and surrendered to the conqueror, who immediately
entered the town in a kind of triumph, and soon after all
Japan submitted to his government. He was, in truth, now
the monarch of Japan. The Emperor was in existence, but
this was only known near Miako by the titles which he occasionally
conferred on those about his court.</p>

<p>Hideyori, the boy representative of Taikosama, was only
seven years of age, and had no very strong claim to be considered
that potentate’s successor, a position which he could
not hold without the assistance of Iyeyas, his wife’s grandfather.
Iyeyas had felt that the peace of the state was depending
upon him, and that, from the position which the
governors had taken up, either he or they must yield; but
neither would give way without an appeal to arms. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
Jesuits seem all along to have shown a want of foresight in
omitting to see that he was the coming man, and made a
mistake in placing their trust in Don Austin, whose position
was now to them a source of great anxiety.</p>

<p>Into the late war there does not seem to have entered
any religious element of discord, as Christians of rank were
found upon both sides. The lords of Arima and Omura and
Kahi no kami (who is frequently mentioned by the Jesuit
writers) were in the army of Iyeyas, while Don Austin
and others took the opposite side.</p>

<p>Ishida, Jiboo no sho, being now a prisoner, was not
likely to receive much mercy at the hands of Iyeyas. Letters
had passed between them which reduced their position
to a personal quarrel. He had already been once spared by
his foe, and had retired on parole to his castle of Sawoyama.
Thinking that an opportunity for revenge had arrived, he
put himself at the head of the army of the confederates. He
had again failed, and now found himself a prisoner in an
ignominious and dishonorable position. But Konishi Setsu,
or Tsu no kami, also a prisoner, ran the risk of losing his
life, more probably from jealousy of his military capacity
than from any other reason. He was the son of a drug
merchant in Sakkai. The eulogiums pronounced upon him
by the Christian writers may pass for what each values
them at; but he had been trusted in a very responsible position
by Taikosama in Corea. He had subsequently been
degraded at the instigation of his rivals, and afterward reinstated
for the accomplishment of schemes requiring the
utmost acuteness in diplomacy, as well as for the execution
of plans requiring military skill and prowess. He had
shown himself capable of both. As an evidence of the position
to which he had raised himself was the marriage of his
son to the granddaughter of Iyeyas himself. He had been
appointed to the office then known as viceroy of the island of
Kiusiu, and was at the same time commander-in-chief both
of the naval and military forces in the Corean war. Had
Iyeyas acted with his ordinary clemency and judgment, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
would after his victory have pardoned such a rival and family
connection; but there were hungry wolves who personally
hated Don Austin, who gloated over his downfall, and
cast longing eyes on his territories, about to be confiscated.
Chief of these was Toronosuqui, “Vir ter execrandus,” as the
Jesuits style him, one of the coarsest men of Japanese history,
but since his death canonized as a saint in the Japanese
calendar as Say sho go sama of the Nitchi ren sect of Buddhists.
Hitherto known by this name of Toronosuqui, he
figures in the subsequent letters of the Jesuits as Canzuge
dono, or properly, as the title now is, Kazuyay no kami.</p>

<p>After his capture, Konishi seems to have been treated
with great rigor—not being allowed to see any of his relatives
or any foreign priest—and was beheaded, along with
the Jiboo no sho, at Awata ngootchi, the common execution-ground
at Miako. His young son was shortly afterward
inveigled and murdered by Mowori, who thought to please
Iyeyas and save himself, after his mean surrender of himself
and his position, by sending the head of Don Austin’s child
to his wife’s grandfather; but Iyeyas was disgusted, and
Mowori in the end was stripped of the greater part of his
possessions.</p>

<p>Native writers agree with the Jesuit accounts in giving
Iyeyas credit for great moderation and sagacity in the use
of the power which had fallen into his hands. Thinking
himself firmly seated, he tried to make all know that he
wished the past to be forgotten—that he was not angry
with those who had been in arms against him, but that he
was grieved that it had been necessary that so much blood
should have been shed. He granted an amnesty to all who
would accept of it; and even some—such as Tatchibanna—who
were not very influential, and who would neither accept
of it nor submit to him, he left quietly alone to allow time
to work. The great secret of his power seems to have been
that when he once made a promise he never broke it, and
the most perfect reliance was placed upon his word. “In
effect, Daifusama, being naturally of a meek and easy temper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
took quite different methods from Taikosama, who had
rendered himself extremely odious by his cruel and severe
oppressions. He proposed to himself to govern more by
love than fear; and therefore, contrary to the maxims of his
predecessor, pardoned several of the lords that bore arms
against him. Moreover, he sent a pardon to Don Austin’s
lady and daughter (who expected, according to law, to have
shared his fate), as also to his brethren and their children;
and, what is more, he did not show any resentment to the
fathers for being constant to the interests of Don Austin, or
for harboring his lady at the time of her retreat at Nanga
saki.” The only unsettled portion of the empire was the
island of Kiusiu. The territory of Don Austin in the province
of Higo was handed over to Katto Kiomassa, or Toronosuqui,
who, as has been said, was a virulent opponent of
the Christian religion. While Don Austin held this territory,
by the advice of his spiritual superiors, every one had
been compelled to be baptized and turn Christian, or to leave
the territory. It was now the turn of the opposite party to
use the same tactics, and most mercilessly they followed the
example set by these Spanish priests both in Japan and in
Europe.</p>

<p>Satsuma, who had escaped from the field of Sekingaharra,
expected that the weight of the victor’s wrath would
shortly fall upon him, and he prepared for it. The subjection
of Kiusiu was intrusted to Kuroda Kahi no kami and
Terasawa Sima no kami, with the lesser lords who had territories
in the island. Satsuma was obliged to yield, and
submitted to Iyeyas, receiving back from him the greater
part of the territory then held by him.</p>

<p>The part of the island of Nippon east of the barrier of
Hakonay, in the province of Segami, is commonly called
Kwanto; and the Hasshiu, or eight provinces beyond the
boundary toward the east part of the island, had more or
less for many years been under the entire rule of Iyeyas.
Kamakura, which had at one period been a rival to Miako
as a second capital, had fallen into decay. Odawara, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
castle of the Hojio family, at the head of the same bay, had
never risen to any position as a central city. The Nishi
maro, a part of the castle of Yedo, had formerly been built
and occupied by Owota do kwang, whose memory is to this
day cherished in Japan, and his name and writings are still
extant on some parts of his castle or shiro. On a summer
house in the garden of the castle is a couplet in poetry which
is looked upon as a prophecy of coming events with reference
to its accomplishment in the present age:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“From this window I look upon Fusiyama,</div>
<div class="verse">With its snow of a thousand years.</div>
<div class="verse">To my gate ships will come from the far East</div>
<div class="verse">Ten thousand miles.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Considering the associations which hung around Miako and
Narra and Osaka as the capitals, imperial, ecclesiastical and
commercial, of the empire, it might be deemed a great stretch
of power and firm confidence in himself and the stability
of his system of government, that Iyeyas should think of
removing the location of the executive to Yedo. He had
doubtless pondered long and deeply over the best system
of government for the country. He had seen the anarchy
which preceded the rise of Nobu nanga to power; he had
seen the want of system by which the structure of government
at that time had crumbled down with the fall of the
one man upon whoso shoulders it had been supported; he
had all the experience since that time to be gained from ruling
an extensive territory of his own, combined with what
observations he might make upon the system of Taikosama.
In the settling of that system, doubtless, he had a large
share; but he went further than Taikosama, and, disregarding
the old associations connected with Miako, he removed
the seat of the executive to his own provinces and to his own
court in the city of Yedo, in what was considered a remote
part of the empire, the inhabitants of which were looked
upon as rude and unpolished, and regarded with contempt
as savages of the east—“Azuma yebis.” The city, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
Iyeyas first took possession of the shiro, consisted only of
one street, known then and now as Koji matchi. It had
increased very much in size under his care, and through
the residence of the court, the Daimios, and their wives
and families, and in no long time became a city of commercial
importance. Although Yoritomo, and the Shiogoons
and Kwanreis who succeeded him, held court at Kamakura
and in the Kwanto, no one had ever called upon the great
feudal lords, or Daimios, as we may now call them, to reside
or keep up establishments there; but Iyeyas seemed to think
that in an empire like Japan, without external foes, strength
would be gained by a division of the empire. All his plans
seem to have had regard to the welfare and peace of the
country rather than the gratification of ambition, which he
never allowed to master his judgment.</p>

<p>This year (1600) and the following Iyeyas devoted to internal
improvements, especially in the highways of the empire.
The road between the two capitals, Yedo and Miako,
was greatly improved. He arranged the stations (tsoongi,
or shooku), to the number of fifty-three, at nearly equal distances
along the road, for the accommodation of Daimios
and others traveling on official business. The Do chioo, or
laws of the roads, were laid down, regulating the traffic, but
more especially the movements and service of these lords
when traveling.</p>

<p>In the year 1603 to Iyeyas was given the hereditary title
and power of Se i dai shiogoon, or tranquilizer of barbarians
and commander-in-chief. The last who had held this office
was Yoshikanga Yoshiteru, who died in 1597. Hideyori
was made Naidaijori.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>HISTORY TO THE EXPULSION OF CHRISTIANITY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> termination of the sixteenth century was in Japan
one of the most notable time-marks in the history of the empire.
It was an era at which a long series of intestine broils
and of civil war came to an end, and gave way to an unexampled
period of peace and happiness. Indirectly, Japan
was affected by changes of greater ultimate results which
had commenced long before at the opposite side of the world.</p>

<p>Portugal, in the zenith of its maritime glory and power,
had hitherto retained in her own hands the navigation and
the trade of the East. Bold as these early navigators were,
the accounts given of their proceedings show them to have
conjoined, in strange recklessness, religion with war, trade
with piracy—“the sweet yoke” of their own ideas of government
with ferocious cruelty to every one opposed to them.
Perhaps this was to some extent necessary, when the health
and prowess of a few men, not easily replaced in case of loss,
were opposed to the climate and weight of numbers whose
losses could easily be recruited by others equally useless and
contemptible as foes. Grotius says of Englishmen of that
time, that they obey like slaves and govern like tyrants.
Toward the latter part of the century, the bigotry of Philip
II. was raising powers against him in Europe, before which
the then colossal but unwieldy empire under his rule was
destined to crumble to pieces. The same intolerant policy
which his emissaries in Japan were pursuing was being carried
out by the old man, in the conscientious belief that he
was furthering and hastening the kingdom of heaven, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
fierce persecution and diabolical atrocities. The dreams
which led men to undertake long voyages to America in
the pursuit of a Utopia, infused a new spirit of boldness
and adventure into the navigators of maritime countries.
At the same time, the Reformation and the changes in the
religious ideas among the people of Europe, and especially
in Holland, England, and for a time in France, tended to
throw contempt on the concessions and grants and privileges
given by the Pope to Portugal, and by which their trade to
the East was up to that time hedged in.</p>

<p>In 1577 Sir Francis Drake broke in upon this monopoly;
and the Spaniards complained of the English infringing their
rights, granted by the Pope, by sailing in the Eastern seas.</p>

<p>The Portuguese vessels which traded with the East had
hitherto carried their produce to Lisbon or Cadiz, and thence
it was carried to the coasts of Europe by the Dutch and
English. But when war broke out between these countries,
Philip, thinking to clip the wings of his enemies, interdicted
this trade. This compelled them to take a longer flight and
seek Eastern commodities at the fountain-head. The navies
of the Dutch and Portuguese came into collision on the Eastern
seas, and the former were victorious, and one after another
of the large Portuguese carracks fell to the English
and Dutch privateers.</p>

<p>In 1599 the East India Company of England was set on
foot, and commenced operations, after being nearly arrested
by the English government to please the Spaniards, by acknowledging
their rights in the Eastern seas; and in 1598
the Dutch fleet sailed, of which William Adams of Gillingham
was pilot.</p>

<p>According to native accounts, in the sixth year of Kay
cho English vessels came to Ike no oora; but one of these
was wrecked during a gale in the Sea of Segami. A message
was dispatched from Yedo to order the crew to be sent
there. Among them was Adams. He remained in Yedo,
but the others returned.</p>

<p>The vessels belonging to the East India Company sailed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
from England upon the eighth voyage, under the command
of Captain Saris, in 1611, with the intention of opening a
trade with Japan. There seemed at this time every prospect
of the Portuguese monopoly being broken up, and of
the trade of this distant country being thrown open to the
Western world. Amid the broils and quarrels with which
Japan was torn, whether among the lords, or between the
Buddhists and Roman Catholics, or the natives and Portuguese
merchants, or the Portuguese and Dutch and English,
it is curious to see the practical and sound good sense
of one man, putting him into a position of eminence and
trust, when all around him was deceit and jealousy. Rising,
after five years of obscurity and hardship, on the ground
of his simple strength of character and practical training,
William Adams seems to have become the trusted confidant
and referee of Iyeyas on foreign questions. Residing in
Yedo, at the southwest corner of the Nihon bashi, or bridge
of Japan, the street where he lived retains to this day the
distinguishing name of “The Pilot’s,” or Anjin. He seems
to have afterward removed to the street Yaiyossu, in close
proximity to the castle moat.—Both Anjin and Yaiyossu
may be corruptions of the name Adams. In Cantonese dialect,
an cham is a word for a compass, and “Adams” might
be written with these characters.—Here his knowledge of
geometry, navigation and mathematics, with some acquaintance
with shipbuilding, brought him under the notice of
Iyeyas, by whom he seems to have been employed as interpreter,
shipbuilder, and general confidant on foreign affairs.
He was ultimately raised to the position of a small Hattamoto,
or lesser baron, with ground equal to the support of
eighty or ninety families, besides his own rental. This estate
is said, in one of the letters from Japan, to be in Segami,
and to have been named Fibi, and situated in the neighborhood
of Ooraga, the port of Yedo, and must certainly be
known to the Japanese government as having belonged to
the English officer.</p>

<p>Doubtless, by all these changes, the position of the Portuguese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
and of the Roman Catholic priests was changed in
Japan. The converts of Nagasaki would see foreigners coming
who paid no respect to the priests and bishops whom
they had been taught to reverence. The powers in the
country would begin to see that the profits of the trade
could be enjoyed without winking at the coercion of their
own people to a foreign religion, and which placed them at
the disposal of a power exterior to the state. The English
and Dutch tried to loosen the hold which their rivals had in
the good opinion of their customers; and the eyes of the
Japanese were thus opened to the evils of admitting to
their shores foreigners who were likely to prove centers of
disaffection and to instill ideas of freedom and lawlessness
among the subjects of the empire.</p>

<p>The letters of the Jesuits throw their own light upon the
state of the Roman Catholic Church in Japan at the different
points where churches or seminaries had been erected,
and it may thence be gathered in what manner they treated
their neighbors, or those over whom they could pretend to
assume any power. On the other hand, from the narratives
given by Cocks and Saris, some idea of the position of the
seafaring communities at Firado and Nagasaki, and other
ports, may be obtained. These seaports seem to have been
too often the resorts of the lowest class of adventurers. The
result was uproars, broils and murders among the foreigners,
requiring ever and anon the intervention of the native
authorities.</p>

<p>Iyeyas was in all probability ignorant of all these circumstances,
which were effecting an indirect change upon those
resorting to the country. At the Roman Catholic party he
had aimed an effectual blow by putting the leading man of
the party, Don Austin, out of the way on grounds totally
unconnected with his religion. And the foreign priests do
not seem to have given him personally much concern at this
time. In the neighborhood of Miako they did not dare of
late to make any public displays. In 1604 there were of the
Jesuits 120 in Japan. They flattered themselves that “as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
for religion, it flourished everywhere, and made vast progress
through all the kingdoms under so easy and peaceable
a government. Notwithstanding, two obstacles still existed—the
one Taikosama’s edict, and the other the vices of the
people. But what gave our religion most reputation was
the gracious reception the Cubo himself [Iyeyas] was pleased
to give the fathers of the Society.” The Jesuits had recently
extended their mission to the extreme north of Japan, and
even into the islands of Yezo and Sado.</p>

<p>During this and the previous year the Jesuits were unfortunate,
inasmuch as the vessels bringing the yearly supplies,
as well as the large annual carrack from Macao to
Japan, were taken by the Dutch privateers; but Iyeyas,
hearing of their loss, presented a donation to the Society,
by which means they “made a tolerable shift for the rest
of this year.”</p>

<p>Terasawa, Sima no kami, who had been governor of
Nagasaki, irritated by the influence brought to bear against
him by the Roman Catholic party at Miako, turned the
weapons they had taught him to use against themselves,
and tried to force his subjects to renounce the new doctrines.
Part of the estates of Don Austin had fallen to his share.
Another part had fallen under the rule of Toronosuqui, who
in the year 1602 “ravaged the vineyard of the Lord like a
wild boar that thirsts after nothing but blood. He began
like a fox and ended like a lion.” Thus it was in the part
of the empire in which most intolerance had been shown by
Don Austin (under the instruction of foreign priests) to his
countrymen, and where they were obliged either to adopt
the Roman Catholic doctrines or leave the country, that the
plan was retaliated upon themselves.</p>

<p>Native accounts tell: “In 1608 a Dutch ship came to
Hirado and asked that Adams might be sent down from
Yedo. He was sent. Iyeyas wrote under the red seal that
the English and Dutch might trade in any part of Japan.
Hide tada also allowed them to trade; but the padre sect
were not allowed to come to Japan. But the English traders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
said that there was no profit to be made out of the trade as
it was obliged to be conducted, and said they could not come
back; therefore the Dutch only remained.”</p>

<p>About this time Iyeyas directed his attention to the internal
economy of the empire—improving the public roads,
placing inns upon them, and strengthening his castles at
Yedo, Suraga, Miako, Osaka, and Kofu. He was aided in
this by the discovery of valuable gold-deposits in the island
of Sado, and the coin the koban was for the first time put
into circulation. During the year 1609 Shimadzu yoshi
hissa, a relative of the Prince of Satsuma, set out from
Satsuma with a force of vessels and troops to bring the King
of the Liookioo Islands more completely under the power
of Japan, and succeeded in his object, receiving the islands
he had conquered as a gift from the hands of Iyeyas.</p>

<p>The designs of Iyeyas against Hideyori began to develop
themselves. Upon the occasion of the investiture of his son
with the title of Shiogoon, he expressed the thought that
Hideyori ought to pay him a visit to compliment him; but
his mother refused to allow Hideyori to do so, protesting she
would rather cut his belly open with her own hand than
allow him to go, thus showing the extreme suspicion she had
of the intentions of Iyeyas.</p>

<p>At this time the Christians enjoyed a profound peace,
which was attributed in the Jesuit letters rather to the fear
of this party joining Hideyori than to any love for the doctrines
promulgated. But at the same time there were men
in power not unfavorable to them, and they were always
able to keep anything obnoxious out of view. Such were
Kowotsuki no kami, the favorite of Iyeyas (called by the
letters Coxuquendono), and Itakura, governor of Miako.</p>

<p>In the year 1606 the Portuguese bishop, Cerqueria, visited
Iyeyas at Miako, and was received by him with the honors
given to one of their own bishops of royal blood. However,
this favor did not seem to last long. The mother of Hideyori,
incensed at some of her ladies having declared themselves
Christians, appealed to Iyeyas. This was an opportunity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
of pleasing her not to be missed, and he issued forthwith
the following proclamation:</p>

<p>“The Cubosama hearing that several of his subjects, contrary
to the late edict, have embraced the Christian religion,
is highly offended. Wherefore let all officers of his court be
careful to see his orders observed. Moreover, he thinks it
necessary, for the good of the state, that none should embrace
that new doctrine; and for such as have already done
so, let them change immediately upon notice hereof.—24th
of the 4th moon” (1606).</p>

<p>No immediate action appears to have been taken upon
this proclamation.</p>

<p>In the year 1607, Iyeyas expressed a desire to see the
Father Provincial. He accordingly set out for Kofu, a castle
in the province of Kahi, where Iyeyas was residing, and here
he was received with much kindness. In their notice of
Yedo the fathers say that Iyeyas employed during the previous
year above 300,000 hands in the works about the castle
of Yedo. The towers of the castle were nine stories high
and gilt at the top, together with delicious gardens, terraces,
galleries, courts, and magnificent works. By these fathers
the mountain Fusiyama is mentioned as an active volcano,
“a mountain of fire, famed for its beauty, height, and whirling
flames.” Even at this time it is to be noticed that all
the “kings of Japan” had their palaces there.</p>

<p>In this tour a slight notice is given to Kamakura (Cumamura,
as it is called by the fathers), “where the Cubos and
Xogoones formerly kept their courts. It is currently reported
that there were upward of 200,000 houses in that
town alone; but when these fathers went that way they
were reduced to near 500.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these slight appearances of returning
favor to the Jesuit fathers, the opposition to conversion increased
as the profits from trade decreased. The ruling
powers in the island of Kiusiu were now more or less against
the Romish priests, who inculcated a line of conduct which
was incompatible with living at peace with a neighbor, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
holding a different view of religion. Nagasaki was in 1607
said to be entirely converted to the Christian religion. It
was divided into five parishes. “There were two confraternities—a
house of mercy and a hospital—which diffused
a sweet odor of sanctity all over Japan.” But this odor did
not extend to the Portuguese who frequented the port, and,
in consequence of some act of misconduct, Iyeyas ordered
Arima (Don Protase, as he is called by the Roman Catholic
writers) to burn a large Portuguese vessel then lying in the
harbor. The consequence was that the captain left the place.
He was pursued by an overwhelming force, and, overtaken
during a calm, was forced to blow up his ship.</p>

<p>During the year 1611, Iyeyas seems to have made up his
mind that, to settle the country upon a sure basis, some
definite understanding must be come to with Hideyori and
his mother. Of what his designs really were there are probably
no proofs, as he was not generally communicative before
action. He marched from Soonpu to Miako at the head of
upward of 70,000 men. The general suspicions of his countrymen
pointed to Hideyori as the cause of a movement on
so large a scale. Arrived at Miako, he insisted upon an
interview with the young man, then twenty-three years
of age. After much delay and show of suspicion, this was
agreed to, and he arrived at the capital with a splendid
retinue. Here he was received with the utmost deference
and kindness by Iyeyas, who shed tears over the remembrance
of his father’s kindness. The visit was returned in
a few days, presents were interchanged, and the prince returned
to his mother at Osaka overjoyed with his reception.</p>

<p>The Jesuit writers notice that during the same year died
Canzugedono, King of Fingo (Toronosuqui), the persecutor
of the Christians; “and, as Heaven would have it, he was
seized with an apoplexy on the very day he was intending
to renew the persecution against the faithful.” Native accounts
attribute his death to poison administered by order
of Iyeyas at Fusimi. He had thrown out some seditious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
and rebellions threats against Iyeyas. Among other things
stated against him, he refused, when ordered, to shave off
his whiskers at court. He was, as has been stated above,
canonized in the Japanese calendar by the title of Say sho
go sama—probably on account of his opposition to foreigners,
and the zeal with which he tried to root out Christianity.
To this day the mark of his hand upon paper is used
as a charm placed over the door to drive away evil spirits.
Since the admission of foreigners in 1858, his character as
a saint worthy of worship has risen in national estimation,
and his temples have been rebuilt. One in Yokohama is
more largely patronized than any other temple in the place.
Processions in his honor are among the most prominent indications
of religious feeling, and the sect to which he belonged,
the Nitchi ren shioo, has profited largely by excitement
and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>During the year, at Nagasaki, notwithstanding the proclamations
which had been issued by government against such
exhibitions, upon the beatification of St. Ignatius of Loyola,
the Society of Jesuits made a solemn procession through the
streets, when forty priests assisted in copes, besides religious
of St. Francis, St. Dominic, and St. Austin, who then resided
in the town. The next day the bishop officiated <i>in
pontificalibus</i>, and the ceremony concluded with illuminations
of joy. The same order was observed at Arima.</p>

<p>During the following year the Shiogoon Hide tada, the
son of Iyeyas, married the sister of Kita Mandocoro, wife of
Taikosama, mother of Hideyori, and niece of Nobu nanga.</p>

<p>Hideyori had still many adherents, who were attached to
him and to his father’s memory. Iyeyas had been afraid
of acting against the Christians so severely as to compel
them to throw their weight into the opposite scale; but he
began to see that he could keep all the advantages of trade
through the Dutch, and get rid of the political dangers which
threatened Japan through the foreign priesthood. The Jesuits
allege that the Dutch encouraged him in these views,
explaining how the Society had been driven out of their countries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
by the princes of Germany and Holland as disturbers
of the public peace.</p>

<p>In 1612 he determined to get rid of these ever-disquieting
agents, the more excited thereto by finding himself in the
meshes of a net out of which he could only break his way
by force. He found that the Prince of Arima, one of the
warmest and most devoted to the cause of Christianity
(whose son had married the granddaughter of Iyeyas), had
been intriguing with the officers at court, to win their good
offices by bribery, in gaining for him large additions to his
territory. He now, for the first time, acted with severity
against some of the native Christians about the court. Fourteen
were condemned to death, but the sentence was commuted
to perpetual banishment and confiscation of their
estates. This action on the part of Iyeyas himself at once
brought out into bolder relief the two parties. Those officers
who had hitherto winked at the Christians, and had permitted
them to carry on their worship and preaching undisturbed,
now saw which way the wind was blowing, and
acted accordingly. This severity was carried into the heart
of the court—one of the concubines of Iyeyas being confined
and banished to the island of Oshima, and thence to the
smaller island of Nishima, and thence to a rock, Cozu shima,
upon which seven or eight fishermen lived in straw huts,
subsisting on what they caught; and these men were ordered
to keep this lady.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, Don Protase of Arima suffered. His
son Michael, who had been brought up as a Christian, fearing
to lose possession of his father’s dominions, informed
against him, accusing him of crimes, and suborning witnesses
against him. Upon the proof offered he was beheaded.
This Christian’s son Michael, who had divorced
a Christian lady to marry the granddaughter of Iyeyas, then
turned apostate, and began a persecution within his territories
of all who professed Christianity. He began, in order
to please Iyeyas, by putting to death two boys, his own
nephews. Here again, where the Jesuits had been most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
intolerant, the tables were turned upon them. In the province
of Boongo, at one time the stronghold of the Roman
Catholics, the same action was being taken; and about this
time, in Yedo, the Shiogoon, on the representation of informers,
put to death some natives who had built a new
church, and banished the father out of the country.</p>

<p>In 1613, Don Michael of Arima was pressed by his wife
and others to renew his severities, and eight Christians were
burned near his castle by slow fires.</p>

<p>In 1614, Iyeyas was stimulated by the opponents of Christianity
to take action against those who professed it. With
the advice of his council he issued orders that all religious,
European and Japanese, should be sent out of the country,
that the churches should be pulled down, and the Christian
members be forced to renounce their faith. To carry out
these orders, all foreign priests and natives, members of the
Jesuit Society, were ordered to leave Miako, Osaka and Fusimi,
and retire to Nagasaki. Hojo Segami no kami was ordered
to see that this order was executed; but he was chosen,
perhaps, from a desire to remove him out of the way, as
well as to take the opportunity of seizing his estate. Accordingly,
while he was so engaged, he was accused of some
crime, and his estates confiscated. The native Christians
were banished to Tsoongaru, at the northern extremity of
the island. At Kanesawa, in Kanga, Justo Ookon dono
Takayama was ordered to leave with the others. Still
further to make sure of the success of his projects, Iyeyas
dispatched to the island of Kiusiu upward of 10,000 men,
under three leaders, for the purpose of overawing the Christians
and putting down any attempts to rise in that quarter.
In Kiusiu the new doctrines had first taken root, and had
flourished with greater luxuriance than on the main island
of Nippon. The lordships were smaller, and therefore the
advantages of trade were proportionably greater in the eyes
of the proprietors. But as in the outset these lesser lords
had favored what seemed to them a source of revenue, when
things turned against the religion they distinguished themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
by zeal in putting down what in the end threatened
to deprive them of everything. In them the government
found the most active and zealous assistants. Many of these
lords or their parents had been baptized. The Jesuits had
there most sway, and had used it with the most intolerance;
and Iyeyas determined, before striking a blow at Hideyori
in Osaka, to remove any chance of a diversion being made
in his favor on the part of the Christians in this distant part
of the empire. But if we believe the letters of the fathers,
the fortitude and courage with which martyrdom was endured
by professing natives must be looked on with admiration.
The better classes lost everything—lands, position,
comforts, in many cases their wives and children, and, last
of all, their lives—in the cause of their faith. The poorer
gave up their lives, all they had to give, with zeal, fortitude,
and even joy.</p>

<p>In the other parts of Kiusiu, in Tsikuzen and Figo, and
in the remote islands of Xequi or Kossiki, the same spirit
was shown toward the Christians; and upon October 25,
1614, three hundred persons—in a word, all the Jesuits, except
eighteen fathers and nine brothers, with a few cathechists
(who lay hid in the country for the help of the faithful)—were
shipped off out of the country by a Portuguese
vessel. This mode of dealing with persons in the position
assumed by these foreigners and their adherents seems to
have been at once lenient, yet determined, and mercenary
without being severe. The party had assumed a political
aspect threatening to the state. The very ladies of his
household had been supported by these foreigners in opposition
to the Kubosama himself. And as it was intended
to be a final political step, and not a religious persecution,
any foreigner found thereafter spreading such intolerant
doctrines would be treated as a political partisan. Justo
was put on board a Chinese vessel with some Spanish priests
and some Japonian clerks, and set sail for Manila, where he
died shortly after his arrival.</p>

<p>The step of removing from the capital and its neighborhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
all the foreign fathers was, in its results, of the utmost
importance to the cause of religion. During the rule of
Nobu nanga and Taikosama, Father Rodriguez, the interpreter,
a man evidently well acquainted with the language
and with the court, was invited or allowed to remain in the
capital. From the accounts sent thence it is evident that by
tact and judgment Father Rodriguez had maintained his
place, that he was in communication with the highest officers
at court, and exercised an unseen but potent power in
behalf of his brethren. With such a person at court, opposition
cannot so easily gain head. Evil reports are warded
off, occasional words in favor can be thrown in; but with
the withdrawal of such a power from the court the foreign
cause becomes powerless. Every one is ready to abuse, and
to chime in to please his superior. There is no possibility of
warding off the blows aimed. It is impossible to know
whether the highest power knows anything of the edicts
put out in his name. The Buddhists, a powerful body,
would be ready to press down upon and thrust out opponents
who had borne themselves so proudly in the day of their
prosperity. Their own tactics recoiled upon the fathers;
and when they were turned out of court, without friends
or advocates, their cause became hopeless, and with their
downfall the position of all other foreigners in the country
was involved.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, not a good defense of the policy adopted
in Japan, to remember that it was nearly identical with that
which England was compelled to adopt at the same time,
and under similar circumstances. In both countries the
change was conducted by the government, and in both the
spirit of the people rose against the interference of a foreign
priesthood with the national concerns. The truth is, that
the doctrine of the Papal supremacy is an “exterritoriality
clause” of itself, which, operating in a country professing
another faith, creates an <i>imperium in imperio</i>, which becomes
very embarrassing to a government, whether it be
Japan or England. The confiscation of abbey-lands in England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
may be compared with, or was analogous to, the confiscation
of the lands of the lords of Japan, while informers
in each were rewarded by a gift of the property belonging
to offenders of less note. The difficulty with which Japan
had to cope was, that there was no mode of escape from
persecution by going into exile into other countries until
the storm had blown over.</p>

<p>In 1615, after getting rid of these politically dangerous
persons, Iyeyas seemed to think that he might push things
to extremities with Hideyori and his mother. He ordered
up all the troops in Kiusiu to Osaka, and thither he repaired
with a large force. He had endeavored for some time to
make Hideyori spend his revenues so freely as to impoverish
his exchequer. He had induced him to rebuild the large
temple of Buddha in Miako, and the day was fixed for the
consecration; but the suspicions of the mother were roused,
and the solemnity was postponed. The young man had presented
a large bell to the temple, upon which, it is said, that
a wish was engraved that Yedo might be destroyed. This
bell is never struck. This was made a pretext for a quarrel,
and as the deserters from the castle reported that it was unprovided,
it was forthwith invested, and war entered upon.
There were many able commanders in the party of Hideyori,
and the castle of Osaka was defended so well that after some
time Iyeyas was obliged to retire and raise the siege, as he
was losing prestige by delay, and men by desertion. An
armistice was agreed upon at the desire of Iyeyas; but it
seems to have been demanded only to give time. The surrounding
country was desolated, and before long hostilities
were renewed; and as a part of the army of Hideyori was
encamped outside, a general battle ensued on June 3, 1615.
In the account of the Jesuits, two of whom were present,
the army of Iyeyas was on the point of defeat, when, probably
through treachery, the castle was set on fire, the troops
of Hideyori became panic-struck, and a total rout and general
slaughter ensued. In the relation by Trigautius it is
stated that in no battle in Japanese history did so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
slaughter take place as in this. The populous neighborhood,
the density of the city, the lawlessness of the troops, all combined
to produce a fearful carnage. No certain information
was ever got of the death of Hideyori or his mother. In all
probability they committed suicide, and their bodies were
destroyed in the conflagration. Reports were circulated of
their having fled—some said to Koya, others to Satsuma;
but as diligent search was made for six months after, and
no trace of them was discovered with certainty either then
or in after years, the common report is likely to be correct.
His natural son was taken and beheaded. After this decisive
battle, Iyeyas, having satisfied himself that he had
made all things sure about Miako and Osaka, returned to
Soonpu, and his son to Yedo. However, Iyeyas did not
live long to gather the fruits of his sowing, or witness the
success of his schemes in the working of his laws. He died
on March 8, 1616, at Soonpu, advising his sons to be kind
to the nobles, and, above all, to govern their subjects in the
spirit of tenderness and affection. He died not without suspicion
of his having been poisoned by his second son, Hideyas,
the elder brother of Hidetada, the Shiogoon. He was buried
in the hills of Nikko, a short distance north of Yedo, with
great splendor. His posthumous title or name and rank is
To sho, Dai Gongen mia (Tung chau, Ta K’iuen hien kung)
d’zo jo itchi-i, Dai jo dai jin—The Eastern Light, the Illustrious
Gem (a Buddhist title for a deified being) of the first
rank, Prime Minister. He is often spoken of as To sho goo
and Gongen sama, but this latter is a generic term, and not
specially applicable to any individual.</p>

<p>The East India Company endeavored, shortly before the
death of Iyeyas, to open a trade with Japan, and the letters
of Captain Saris, Cocks, and others, give an interesting account
of the country at the time. In answer to a letter from
the King of Great Britain, Iyeyas granted to his majesty’s
subjects certain privileges of trade, and the settling of a factory
in Japan, and confirmed these under his broad seal for
the better determining thereof. This document, a fac-simile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
of the original, is to be seen in Purchas. For sufficient reasons,
the factory was in no long time withdrawn, and the
trade entirely ceased in 1621.</p>

<p>In 1619 some notice of the persecutions carried on against
Christians is given in Mr. Cocks’ letter, which corroborates
the accounts received through the Roman Catholic channels,
and is worthy of note as being written by one who evidently
bore no great goodwill to that form of the Christian religion,
and will render it unnecessary to allude further to the fearful
particulars detailed by Trigautius and others:</p>

<p>“The persecution in this country, which before proceeded
no further than banishment and loss of civil and religious
liberties, has since (as this letter tells us) run up to all the
severities of corporal punishment. The Christians suffered
as many sorts of deaths and torments as those in the primitive
persecutions; and such was their constancy that their
adversaries were sooner weary of inflicting punishments than
they of enduring the effects of their rage. Very few, if any
at all, renounced their profession; the most hideous forms
in which death appeared (by the contrivance of their adversaries)
would not scare them, nor all the terrors of a solemn
execution overpower that strength of mind with which they
seemed to go through their sufferings. They made their
very children martyrs with them, and carried them in their
arms to the stake, choosing rather to resign them to the
flames than leave them to the bonzes to be educated in the
pagan religion. All the churches which the last storm left
standing this had entirely blown down and demolished, and
heathen pagodas were erected upon their ruins.”</p>

<p>Edict after edict emanated, or at least were said to emanate,
from the Shiogoon, ordering more and more severe
action to be taken against the Christians. There remained
no power of verifying these edicts, no one to speak a word
at court for the unfortunate creatures; while they were surrounded
by hungry wolves, who might invent edicts in order
to profit by the confiscation of property, whose interest it
was that the infant heir should be destroyed with his father,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
and who were further incited by the priests, or bozangs, who
gnashed their teeth in the hour of victory over enemies who
had lorded it so proudly over them in the short days of their
prosperity. By such ferocity, combined with a strict watch
kept up on foreign vessels, the Christian religion was nearly
extirpated; but in the district of Arima, nearly the whole
of the inhabitants, having all their lives professed Christianity,
at last in desperation resolved rather to fight than submit
to such a system of persecution.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>THE LAWS OF IYEYAS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Iyeyas</span> had shown himself an able commander, and an
astute, if a somewhat unscrupulous, diplomatist. He is
known to this day as a legislator. Hitherto the country
seems to have been governed by the laws of Tankaiko, and
these are still in force. But Iyeyas thought it necessary to
lay down rules for those who formed his own court—the
military chiefs (with their two-sworded followers), whom he
intended to act as the executive throughout the empire. He,
to this end, issued one hundred rules or directions as his testament,
to be bequeathed to his descendants in power, as a
guide to them in the office which he hoped would be hereditary
in his family. It is said that Iyeyas was assisted in
drawing up this code by Nijio dono, Kon chi eeng, Tenkai
sojo and Kanga. The originals are now kept at the temple
of Koo no san, and it is intended that no one but the ministers
of state shall ever see them. These rules are commonly
called “Bookay hiak kadjo”—the hundred lines or rules for
the military class. The title is Go yu i jowo or Yu i geng
or gong—the last testament of Tosho goo, in one hundred
sections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>The following translation of these rules is to be looked
upon as a mere sketch, or such defective information as a
Japanese who understood little English could convey to the
author, who understood little Japanese, and the division into
100 sections is difficult to ascertain in the original.</p>

<p>* No one is to act simply for the gratification of his own
desires, but he is to strive to do what may be opposed to his
desires—<i>i.e.</i>, to exercise self-control—in order that every one
may be ready for whatever he may be called upon by his
superiors to do.</p>

<p>* The aged, whether widowers or widows, and orphans,
and persons without relatives, every one should assist with
kindness and liberality, for justice to these four is the root
of good government.</p>

<p>* Respect the gods, keep the heart pure, and be diligent
in business during the whole life.</p>

<p>* If the Kubosama (or Shiogoon) should die childless,
then Ee, Honda, Sakakibarra, and Sakai,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> together with the
older and most able servants of the Kubosama, are to meet
together, and, no matter whether he be distantly or nearly
related, they are to fix upon the man most worthy, and of
most merit, as successor.</p>

<p>* Upon whomsoever the Mikado may confer the title of
Se i shio goon, it is ordained that the customs shall continue
as in the time of Kamakura dono (Yoritomo).</p>

<p>* All the rice produce (cheegio) of the empire (at my disposal)
amounts to 28,900,000 koku. Of this, I arrange that
20,000,000 is to be divided among the Daimios and Shomios
or Hattamoto, and the remaining 8,900,000 koku shall belong
to the Kubosama.</p>

<p>* It is the duty of the Kubosama to guard from danger
the Emperor and his palace, and to preserve peace and tranquillity
in the empire in every direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>* All the Bookay—<i>i.e.</i>, military officers—are to take care
that the laws of the empire are not lightly changed; but as
sometimes necessity may arise for a change, they may yield
on special occasions.</p>

<p>* All Daimios and Hattamotos who adhered to me and
my cause up to the time of the war at Osaka (with Hideyori)
are to be Fudai. Those who since that time have given in
their adhesion, and have remained steadfast, are Tozamma
(Ch., ngoy yeong), outside lords. Of Tozamma there are
eighty-six, of Fudai eight thousand and twenty-three, and
of Kammong, or relations of my family, thirteen. Of visitors
(lords who visit Iyeyas on equal terms, called Okiaksama
or Hin re-i), five, who are:</p>

<table class="left">
<tr><td>1. Kitsure gawa dono,</td><td rowspan="2"> <span class="xxxlarge">}</span> </td><td rowspan="2"> descendants of Yoritomo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2. Iwa matz manjiro,</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="left">3. Matzdarra Tajima no kami, who was the seventh son
of Hideyas (elder brother of Hidetada), and so grandson of
Iyeyas. He was adopted by Taikosama, but was returned
to his father on the birth of Hideyori, and was afterward
adopted by Yuki.</p>

<p>4. Tatchibanna hida no kami—of a very old illustrious
family. He was military teacher of Iyaymitz ko, third Kubosama,
and would not acknowledge Iyeyas as his superior,
but had not much power, and was not disturbed by Iyeyas.</p>

<p>5. Tokungawa Mantokuji was a very old branch of the
Tokungawa line.</p>

<p>* Ko fhoo jo nai (a name of the shiro or castle of Yedo;
the Chinese characters are different from the Ko fu of the
province of Kahi, where the Shiogoon has a castle) presents
on the left side the shape of a dragon, on the right, that
of an (washi) eagle; to the northwest lies the second, Kuko
or Maro; to the north lies the third; to the west, the fourth;
to the southwest, the fifth.</p>

<p>The O ban goomi, or large guard of the Kubosama, consisting
of twelve companies, may be likened to the twelve
gods (the Yakushi riorai). The Sho eeng bang—the lesser
guard of ten companies—are like the ten stars. The Dzeng<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
koo or Sakitay (who lead the van in war) are thirty-three
companies, like the thirty-three heavens. The Mochizutzu,
musqueteers (who fire balls of five momays weight), are
seven companies, like the Stchi wo or seven lights—the sun,
moon and planets. The Sho ban gashira, numbering twenty-eight,
are similar to the twenty-eight stars. The Ro shing—<i>i.e.</i>
old servants (acting as the Gorogiu or cabinet)—are
as the four heavens. Over them, and higher, is placed the
Shiogoon. These are all so arranged to suit well-known and
easily remembered arrangements in the Buddhist books of
religion.</p>

<p>* There are many Fudai, but of this class the Mikawa,
or old Fudai, are to rank the highest. Of these there are
fourteen: 1, Tori yee; 2, Itakura; 3, Owokubo; 4, Todda;
5, Honda; 6, Ogassawara; 7, Akimoto; 8, Sakakibarra; 9,
Sakkye; 10, Ishikawa; 11, Kooze; 12, Katto; 13, Abbe;
14, ——. Of these families, if able men can be found
among them, the Gorogiu or cabinet is to be chosen. Tozamma
Daimios, however able they may be, cannot have
seats in the Gorogiu, or take any part in government.</p>

<p>* The families and names of all Daimios, large and
small, who have acted with me in my wars, shall continue
(<i>i.e.</i>, shall not be removed from the peerage), however
badly they conduct themselves, unless they turn rebels
or traitors.</p>

<p>* In regard to the Koku shiu, Rio shiu, Jo shu (classes of
Daimios—the first, lord of a province; the second, lord of a
district; the third, lord of a castle), Tozamma and Fudai, if
they break the laws and oppress the people, no matter how
old the line or how large their territory, I will use my power
and forces to brush them away from both territory and castle.
This is the duty of the Shiogoon alone.</p>

<p>* Among officers the different ranks are to be observed,
each according to his rank or his official income; but if they
are equal in both, the eldest in years shall take precedence.</p>

<p>* The President of the Hio jo sho [a deliberative court
in Yedo with judicial powers] must be selected as being a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
man of the clearest mind and best disposition; and once
every month it shall be the duty of the Shiogoon to go to the
meeting, without giving previous notice of the day, when he
himself must decide on the questions brought before him.</p>

<p>* Each province is divided into kowori, sho, mura, and
sato—districts, parishes, villages, and hamlets. In the mura
and sato, should there be any family of old standing among
the lower classes, even though the head of it may be very
poor, he ought to be appointed officer; and if a rich man
settles in the village, he is not to be made an officer. This
is to be the law in all territories, whether of a Koku shiu,
Rio shiu, Jo shu, or Ji towo (ground-head, <i>i.e.</i>, landed proprietor,
not eligible to office).</p>

<p>* All Daimios and Hattamotos not in office (<i>i.e.</i>, not
residing at Yedo), whether Tozamma or Fudai, are commanded
not to be unjust toward me. My business is to
guard the Emperor and his court and the whole empire of
Japan, and I command you to assist me in repairing and
keeping up all the imperial castles, roads, rivers, and guards.</p>

<p>* The repairing the Shiogoon’s residence, the keeping
in repair public roads, keeping up ferries, etc., is Fushin;
Daimios are sometimes called shokowo; when they are acting
as guards, as in Kanagawa, they are “Katamme”; and
in keeping up these guards, the whole expense is borne by
the Daimios.</p>

<p>* Irayzumi, the marking a criminal with ink or gunpowder;
Go ku mong, putting a decapitated head in a box
for exposure; Haritske, spearing on a cross; Ushizaki, tying
four oxen’s tails to a man’s limbs, and starting them off by
fire to tear off the limbs; Kumma iri, boiling a criminal in
hot water. These are old punishments for criminals. The
officers are to try to discover who are worthy men, and they
are to be rewarded with territory, titles, and rank. Criminals
are to be punished by branding (or marking), or beating,
or tying-up, and, in capital cases, by spearing or decapitation;
but the old punishments of tearing to pieces and
boiling to death are not to be used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>* When I was young I determined to fight and punish
all my own and my ancestors’ enemies, and I did punish
them; but afterward, by deep consideration, I found that the
way of heaven was to help the people, and not to punish
them. Let my successors follow out this policy, or they are
not of my line. In this lies the strength of the nation.</p>

<p>* In regard to filling in new ground, if there are no objections,
it may be done according to the laws in force in the
time of Yoritomo; but if objections are made (by neighbors
or others), it is not to be carried out.</p>

<p>* In case also of wishing to make new canals (hori), or
lakes (Ikay), reservoirs of water, old precedents are to guide
the officers.</p>

<p>* If there be a lawsuit as to a property or a road, if it is
shown to have existed fifty years, the question cannot afterward
be reopened.</p>

<p>* Among officers outside and inside there are at times
unseemly brawls as to rank, but these are all to be settled
now, and I settle them accordingly in the following order:</p>

<p>Tai ro sin, Orussuee, Tai ro jiu (now Gorojiu), Soshi,
Osaka jio dai, Soonpu riobang, Waka doshi yori, Soba yo
nin, Kokay, Sosha, Jeesha boonyo, Oku toshi yori (obsolete),
Nishi maro russui, Owo metske, Kotai yori yaï, Hira toshi
yori (obsolete), Kanjo boonyo, Matchi boonyo, Oku ko sho
ngashira, Naka oku ko sho, Sho eeng ban gashira, O ban
gashira, Shin ban gashira, Onando kashira, Ko nando
kashira, Krii no ma tsu may bang, Gan no ma tsu may
bang, Fuyo no ma yakunin, Tskyebang, Ki roku sho yakunin
and Hio moku no mono, Ten shoo bang, Hozo bang,
Hatta boonyo, Katana ban gashira, Motchi yumi ngashira,
Motchi tsudzu gashira, Sakitay gashira, Yari boonyo, Kooshi
boonyo, Ma ya betto, Funatay ngashira, Makanai gashira,
Jusha, Eeshi, Fushing boonyo, Tan sz boonyo, Do bo ngashira,
Zashiki bang, Hi no ban gashira, Katchi metske gashira,
Kobito gashira, Iga no kashira, Kurokwa kashira, Tayshi
gashira. And below this rank, all the captains or officers
of companies will settle the ranks. When the official income<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
is above 10,000 koku, the Roshing or Gorogiu shall settle,
below this the Waka toshi yori. The highest of all is the
So to rio, the Tai ro shin, or Go tai ro, or Sosai; <i>i.e.</i>, the
Regent.</p>

<p>* There are men who always say Yes (<i>i.e.</i>, agree with
me), and there are others who sometimes say No (<i>i.e.</i>, express
a different opinion from me). Now, the former I wish
to put away from me, and the latter I wish to be near me.
The elders of the Gorogiu are to examine and see that men
do not do such business only as is agreeable to them, and
avoid all that is the reverse. I wish to have about me all
opinions of men, both those who differ from me and those
who agree with me.</p>

<p>* If some man should say such a one deserves to be put
to death, the officers must not act upon his wish alone; but
if all the people say such a one should be put to death, the
officers must examine into the case; and if all the people say
such a one should be rewarded, I myself must examine, or
the country will be lost.</p>

<p>* As to cormorant-fishing and hawking, some men used
to say that these amusements were useless and expensive,
and they were in consequence interdicted. But I do not
prohibit them. They strengthen the body, and, with riding,
archery, hunting, and shooting, are not to be forgotten or
omitted in time of peace by the military classes in the empire.</p>

<p>* Singing, dancing, and music are not strictly military
occupations, and soldiers ought not to devote themselves to
these accomplishments; but at times the mind is oppressed,
and the heart is heavy, and requires relaxation and mirth,
and therefore these are not to be altogether prohibited.</p>

<p>* I am descended from the Emperor Saywa Ten wo,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
my family had lost all its property through the power of our
enemies, and had sunk down to Matzdaira [a small village
in Mikawa, from which the family of Iyeyas takes its name];
but through the kindness of the Emperor I have, relying
upon documents and history, changed (or traced) the name
of my family to Seratta, and Nitta, and Tokungawa, and in
all time coming this last is to remain the name of the family.</p>

<p>* I have fought ninety battles, and narrowly escaped with
my life eighteen times. Having so escaped, I therefore out
of gratitude erected eighteen temples, and I wish my sons
and descendants to adhere to the Iodo sect (of Buddhists).</p>

<p>* In Booffoo (the military office; <i>i.e.</i>, Yedo) I built the
temple of To yay san, and requested the Mikado to install
as chief-priest a Sinwo—<i>i.e.</i>, of the royal family of the first
rank (he is now known as Oo yay no mia, and is the most
illustrious personage in Yedo in point of birth and honors
acceded to him: he lives in To yay zan, a residence formerly
the property of Toda, Idzumi no kami)—to pray that the evil
influences of the devil may be warded off, and that peace
and prosperity may prevail over Japan. And also in order
that if the Mikado should be induced to side with traitors or
foreigners, and these concert with or gain possession of the
person of the Mikado, then the Dai Shiogoon shall install
the Oo yay no mia as Mikado, and punish the rebels.</p>

<p>* From ancient times there have been different sects of
religion other than the Jashiu (Crooked sect; <i>i.e.</i>, Christians).
Now any one of the people can adhere to which he
pleases (except the Christian); and there must be no wrangling
among sects, to the disturbance of the peace of the
empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>* The families of Minna moto, Taira, Fusiwara, Tatchibanna,
Soongawara, Oway, Ariwara, and Kiowara, are all
direct descendants of Mikados. Out of these families the
head of the military must be chosen. If there be among
these families men of good character, but uneducated, cowardly,
and ignorant of the way of holiness, such are not to
be selected for this office. Therefore it is necessary that
all the members of these families should be diligent in
study.</p>

<p>* To insure the empire peace, the foundation must be laid
in the ways of holiness and religion; and if men think they
can be educated, and will not remember this, it is as if a
man were to go to a forest to catch fish, or thought he could
draw water out of fire. They must follow the ways of
holiness.</p>

<p>* All men are liable to sickness. If doctors become rich
they grow indolent, therefore it is improper that they should
acquire territory or landed property, but they are to be paid
by every one, high and low, according to the visits paid.</p>

<p>* Those who study the stars, and the higher orders of
Sinto priests, formerly spread the idea that they were worthy
of equal reverence with the gods. If in future they presume
to do so, they are to be punished.</p>

<p>* In former times, when high-priests and ministers of the
Buddhist religion committed crimes, and were liable to punishment,
the people thought that to punish them was the
same as punishing the gods. They are to think so no more,
but the military officers are to punish such offenders without
fear.</p>

<p>* Booffoo, Osaggi, Booggi, Itchiko Meeko, Nobooshi,
Yamabooshi, Gozay [these are different kinds of impostors,
fortune-tellers, diviners, fox magicians, mesmerizers, clairvoyants,
etc.], Maykura, and vagabonds who go about without
regular business and breaking the laws, raising quarrels,
must all be punished.</p>

<p>* Let every gentleman with the right to wear a long
sword remember that his sword is to be as his soul, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
he is not to part from it but with his life. If he forget his
sword he must be punished.</p>

<p>* In the Nengo of Boon ro ku, 1592-96, the two officers
Ogochi and Assano surveyed all Japan. They made a
report, which was laid before the Emperor. A survey of
the provinces, counties, districts and parishes was made,
together with the forests, mountains, rivers, and a calculation
was made of the value. If a man possess land yielding
1,000 koku, he is to provide five horsemen. If 10,000, 50
horsemen. If 50,000, 250 horsemen. If 100,000 koku, 1,000
horsemen. This is one “goon” or regiment. 3,000 horsemen
make one battalion, over which is placed one general or
Jo sho. Over 2,000 is placed a Lieutenant-general, or Chiu
sho. Over 1,000 is placed a Kasho, or Major-general [all
this is altered now]. But I have a regard for old customs
and long service, therefore the house of Ee shall be over all
the generals. Ee man chiu was my general, therefore I presented
him with a gold Sai hae [a baton like a fan, used by
high military officers]; and I made Honda “Kasho,” and
gave him a paper Sai hae. The above arrangement all military
officers are to make themselves acquainted with.</p>

<p>* If disputes arise as to the boundaries of the territories
(Rioboong of Daimios or of Hattamoto), these are to be referred
to an Owometske and the Kanjo boonyo, the head of
the Treasury. But if the disputants refuse to abide by the
decision, and fighting ensues, the ground in dispute shall be
confiscated by the Shiogoon.</p>

<p>* Byshings (Ch., Peichin)—<i>i.e.</i>, large retainers of Daimios—even
if they have large landed possessions, and are
equal in wealth to Daimios, are not on the same footing with
Jiki shing (<i>i.e.</i>, retainers of the Shiogoon), and are always
inferior to the latter in rank, even though superior in wealth.</p>

<p>* In fights among the common people, even if two or
three are killed on one side, both parties are to be looked
upon as criminal, and to be punished, but not so severely
as if a man out of forethought murders another, and does
not act on the heat of the moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>* If a man employs another to commit a murder, if a
man poisons, and wishes to make profit or advantage to
himself out of a murder, or if a thief murders to steal, such
men must be discovered, even if the grass of all Japan is
looked through.</p>

<p>* Of the four employments in Japan—the Samurai, two-sworded
gentlemen; the Hyaksho, the farmer; Shokonini,
artisan; and the Akindo, merchant—the Samurai is the first
in rank. If one of the other three are rude in conduct to a
Samurai, he himself can punish him. But among Samurai
there are different ranks, some being Jiki shing, others Byshing,
retainers of the Shiogoon and retainers of Daimios,
and others servants of Byshings, who also are Kimi and
Shing, master and servant. If among any of these an inferior
is rude or impolite or insolent, then he is to be treated
as if he were an Akindo; <i>i.e.</i>, a merchant.</p>

<p>* That one man and one woman should live together is
a great law of nature, therefore at the age of sixteen all men
and women ought to be married. But no man is allowed to
marry a woman of the same surname with himself, but examination
must be made as to the parentage and line of descent
of the betrothed, and thus the way of heaven will be
adhered to.</p>

<p>* If a man have no son he may adopt one, but the father
must be fifteen years of age before he adopts a son. If a
Daimio or Hattamoto have no son or adopted son, the line
becomes extinct. But if the last heir of a Daimio’s family
be very delicate and sickly, he may, even if young, adopt
a child to keep up the line of the house. This is the way of
Confucius.</p>

<p>* (In old times the Mikado went round the provinces.)
Hereafter an officer must go round all the provinces once
every five or seven years, and make a report to the Shiogoon.
(This is now obsolete.)</p>

<p>* As to the old Kokoshu, I will not interfere with their
provinces; but in the case of recently made Kokoshu and
Daimios, if they keep the same territory for a very long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
time, they become proud, and oppress the people, therefore
in the case of these latter it is well to change them occasionally
from one territory to another.</p>

<p>* Among Hyaksho, Shokonin, and Akindo—<i>i.e.</i>, farmers,
artisans, and merchants—if their wives secretly commit
adultery, the law of nature is broken; and whether the husband
report the matter to the officers or not is of no consequence,
both parties must be punished; but if the husband
is a proper spirited man, and puts the adulterer to death, he
is not to be punished. But if he should wish to pardon both
the wife and her paramour, it may be done. The judge is
not to be hasty.</p>

<p>* If the same thing take place in the family of a Samurai,
the judge must be very severe and strict in punishing.</p>

<p>* In Japan there is an old saying that the same heaven
cannot cover a man and the enemy (murderer?) of his father
or mother or master or elder brother. Now, if a man seek
to put to death such an enemy, he must first inform the Kets
dan sho [this is a department which takes cognizance of
criminal matters] office at the Hio jo sho, and say in how
many days or months he can carry out his intention. This
is to be entered in the book of the office. If he kills this
enemy without such previous intimation, he is to be considered
as a murderer.</p>

<p>* If a servant kills his master, he is to be considered as
the same as the Emperor’s enemy, and his relations are all
likewise to be considered in the same light, and must be extirpated
root and branch. If a servant has made the attempt,
even if unsuccessful, the family is to be extirpated.—Kando
is to take the name of a family out of the book of Japan.</p>

<p>* In regard to wives and concubines, the law and customs
are the same as between master and servant. The
Mikado is allowed twelve concubines. Daimios and Hattamotos
are allowed to have eight. Tei fu—<i>i.e.</i>, men with
titles—and Sho daibu are allowed five. Officers and Samurai
are allowed two concubines. This is to be found in the old
holy books of the Rai ki rites and ceremonies (Lei, king of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
China). At times very foolish and bad men have made the
way to the Rai ki dark, and have addicted themselves to
numerous concubines, and so broken the laws of nature. In
former times, whenever Daimios or officers have lost their
territories and castles, it may in nearly all cases be traced
to this cause. Hence the man is not upright who is much
given to women.</p>

<p>[It is a common error with writers upon Japan to allege
that the Japanese are indifferent to the respectability of their
wives; and, indeed, that they rather prefer to take one from
among the public courtesans; and, further, to convey the
impression that nearly all the women of the country go
through some such course before marriage. Such an idea
is contrary to common sense as well as to propriety; and the
common belief that the spirits take a warm interest and perform
an important part in the marriage of every pair in
Japan shows that the rite itself is looked upon as a very
important institution, requiring Divine sanction and blessing,
and not to be lightly entered upon for the gratification
of temporary or transient feelings. On the other hand, intercourse
between parties not married is looked upon as disreputable,
or at least an attempt is made to convey such an
impression to young persons. All such connections are called
“damass koto,” <i>i.e.</i>, a false, a sham affair; and it is said of
such persons that the fox—<i>i.e.</i>, the devil—has tied the yeng
or knot. It is a common saying by youths, “I know that it
is damass koto; but the fox always brings us together again,
and I cannot cut the thread.” As their idea of the yeng is
taken from the Chinese, it shows that polygamy is not, with
that large portion of the human race, looked on with approval.
In China the first wife is the only wife; the others
who may be taken afterward are concubines. In these countries
the position of a prostitute is different from what it is
in Christian communities, as they are forced to the life, and
educated to it from childhood; and the education and mixing
with the world in conversation gives them often a cleverness
and power of pleasing which are often wanting in the ladies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
brought up in the quiet and seclusion of a Chinese family.
Besides, they go to the same churches and worship the same
gods, going through their devotions as religiously as the rest
of the community.]</p>

<p>* The relations of the husband are with external things,
those of the wife with internal. The observance of this leads
to the peace or smooth-working of the empire. If these relations
are changed, folly ensues, the house is deranged, and
it is as if a hen were to crow in the morning. All men are
to take care to avoid the beginning of this evil.</p>

<p>* At Iwatski, and at Kawagoi in Musashi, and at Sakura
and Seki yado and Koga in Simosa, and at Takasaki and
Oossuee in Kowotsuki, and at Ootsu no mia in Shimo tsuki,
and at Odawara in Segami, nine places are to be castles,
which are as the guards or outposts of Yedo. The Daimios
in possession of these castles are to act in unison with Yedo
as a center.</p>

<p>* At the castles of Soonpu and Kunowo there must be
placed able commanders, as these places are the keys of
Yedo; to Osaka in Setsu and Fushimi in Yamashiro, officers
of the fourth rank must be sent, and an able Fudai Daimio,
besides twelve captains. If war begins, Osaka and Fusimi
are the keys of the country.</p>

<p>* To the Nijio castle of the Kubosama at Miako one of
the principal Fudai must be sent, who must be a general,
because he is the head of the executive at Miako, and has
the direction of the San jiu san koku; <i>i.e.</i>, the thirty-three
provinces west of Miako.</p>

<p>* In the provinces round Yedo there are sixteen gates
where travelers are examined. At each of these gates a
Fudai must be stationed, to see that the laws are observed,
and that not a spear the size of a needle passes toward Yedo,
but pack-horses and carriages may pass.</p>

<p>* The office of Kiusiu Tandai (the Viceroy of the island
of Kiusiu) was formerly held by the Owotomo family. Since
this family has been destroyed, the office has been in abeyance.
I now command Shim adzu and Nabeshima (Satsuma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
and Fizen) each to act as Viceroy in alternate years, and
will not permit any other to fill the office.</p>

<p>* Within the castle of Yedo are twenty-eight places or
gates (Bansho or Mitskay), with guards; without there are
twenty-eight. Those within the castle are to be kept by
Fudai, those outside by Tozamma.</p>

<p>* In regard to San kin [those who are officially on duty
in Yedo] officers, care must be taken to note such as are diligent
and such as are indolent, and they are to be rewarded
or punished accordingly. Those who are rich are to be put
into situations entailing expense, and those who are poor into
the less expensive.</p>

<p>* All the Daimios on duty in Yedo are not to be employed
simultaneously, as some may be suddenly required for extraordinary
service.</p>

<p>* Foreign ships are allowed to come to Nagasaki. Old
and trustworthy officers are to be sent there. The kimbang
or guards are to be four captains, whose official income shall
be more than 3,000 kokus each. There are to be both foot
and horse soldiers. As the expenses are great there, the
Yakunins or officers must receive yaku rio; <i>i.e.</i>, additional
money according to their business.</p>

<p>* As by convulsions of nature, such as earthquakes, the
courses of rivers are changed, lakes are made or dried up,
and mountains overthrown, the expense of repairing these
ravages and paying the laborers is to be borne by all Daimios
in proportion to their revenues.</p>

<p>* In all the empire the main roads are to be six keng wide
(or about sixty feet<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>). Cross-roads are to be three mats
wide or eighteen feet; Yoko mitchi, or bridle-paths, two
mats; Katchi mitchi, walking paths, one mat or six feet;
Sakuba mitchi or tchika mitchi, less than three feet. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
either side of a ferry landing, ground is to be left to the
width of sixty mats, or 360 feet, so that when many persons
may collect care may be taken. This is the custom as to
ferries ever since the time of my ancestor, Nitta, Oee no
skay, Yoshi shige, Nioo do, called “Josay dono.”</p>

<p>* All the revenues arising from rates levied at ferries,
lakes, hills, etc., are not to be used by the military department,
but are reserved for the Mikado’s treasury.</p>

<p>* It is not allowed to any one to build a house in the middle
of wheat or rice fields, as the shadow of the house and
trees spoils the surrounding ground, and renders it unproductive.
If any dare so to build, all the building is to be
swept away, and he is to be confined for 100 days.</p>

<p>* For the settlement of what is old plantation and what
is new, it is decided that Furui yama, or old trees, are those
which at the level of the eye are three feet or more in circumference.
Atarashi yama, or new plantations, are trees
which are less than three feet at the level of the eye.—At
one time this was a source of great trouble in Japan.</p>

<p>* If a large tree overshadows a neighbor’s house or drying-floor,
so that rice, grain or wheat cannot be exposed to
the sun, when necessary the branches may be cut off.</p>

<p>* Every year the Kanjo sho is to send in a report of bad
bridges, roads, etc., in need of repair.</p>

<p>* In the good old-fashioned times the relations of master
and servant were like those of water and fish, but now, in
these times, people are apt to become proud and to dislike
their work, but every one is to do faithfully the work assigned
to him, and not to throw his work or duties on another.
This is very important to be remembered, and is not
difficult to be learned. The result is like water flowing
down encircling the country, at which all the people rejoice.</p>

<p>* Honcho, or Japan, is the (Shin koku) country of spirits.
Therefore we have among us the Jiu (Confucianism), Shaku
(Buddhist), Sen (Ch., Tseen), Do (Taouist), and other sects.
If we leave our gods (Shin), it is like refusing the wages of
our master and taking them from another. Therefore a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
watch is to be kept as to this. But as to Itchiko (divination)
and Buddhistic practices, the workers are not to be
driven away, but the people are not to follow them.</p>

<p>* In regard to dancing-women, prostitutes, brothels, night
work, and all other improper employments, all these are like
caterpillars or locusts in the country. Good men and writers
in all times have written against them. But as it is a law
of nature that man should desire the society of woman, it is
enacted that these people and places shall not be tolerated;
but as it would, if the laws were rigidly carried out, be a
perpetual punishing and nothing else, they are not to be
administered severely, but out of a regard for the uneducated
and the nature of mankind these offenses are to be lightly
passed over.</p>

<p>* It has been the wont of my ancestors ever to follow out
the thread of the customs of (Yoritomo) Kamakura dono,
and no other customs are to be observed. But the heart
and goodness of Hige mori (Komatzu dono, eldest son of Kio
mori) is never to be forgotten.—This refers to the steady
opposition made by him to the “mauvais desseins” of his
father, Kio mori, against the family of Yoritomo in 1170-80
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> He is called in the “Annales des Empereurs” “homme
habile, vertueux, et juste.” He was extremely distressed at
hearing of the treachery of his father in inviting the regent
to a conference, and then ordering him to be cut to pieces.
After his death, Kio mori, seeing no one to oppose him, regardless
of everything, acted according to his own pleasure.</p>

<p>* When a master dies, his servants think it their duty
to commit suicide. This is an old custom, but it is quite
unreasonable, and nothing can justify a man in so acting.
Sometimes, instead of committing suicide, there is a custom
of putting into the grave figures representing servants.
This is more unreasonable than the other. Such persons are
not upright, and those who in future do these things must be
severely punished.</p>

<p>* If war arise, the (Taisho) commander-in-chief has no
other business but to mold men to his use. The master of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
men must know what each is useful for. Men are like instruments—one
cannot do the work of a chisel with a hammer;
one cannot make a small hole with a saw, but a gimlet
must be used. The principle is the same as to men. Men
with brains are to be used for work requiring brains; men
of strong frame for work requiring strength; men of strong
heart for work requiring courage. Weak men are to be put
into poor places. Every man in his proper place. There are
places for weak men and places for fools. All this must be
regulated by the head and brains of the Taisho. Soldiers
are to be chosen on these principles, so that with a thousand
men in one body, the whole may act together, and the empire
have peace. This is always to be kept in memory.</p>

<p>* If one man rises to be full of, or puffed up with, military
power (Boo i ippai), he will try to make himself equal
with or superior to the highest, the Mikado. This is a very
serious error; there is always a tendency to it. But when it
happens, it is natural that he should become proud, and not
respect the Mikado. The land of spirits—<i>i.e.</i>, Japan—will
be lost. The judgment of Heaven will assuredly fall upon
him.—This is intended for his successors, the Shiogoons,
who might be puffed up with their position.</p>

<p>* The Sinwo kay and Mia gata—<i>i.e.</i>, the families of
those of the royal blood—are the supporters of the Mikado.
All the high ranks of the Mikado’s court, the Koongyo and
the Koongays, are not to alter the old laws of the empire,
but are to pay the highest respect to the Mikado, and are
not to be rude or insolent.</p>

<p>* As to the Hinrei Skiaku [the descendants of old Shiogoons,
such as Ashikanga, Hojio and others, to whom rank
and territory have been assigned], their history and pedigree
are to be inscribed in a book. What their customs may be
is of no consequence to me, but if they interfere with the
laws or the government established by me, or even if they
become very proud and oppress the people, I will punish
them.</p>

<p>* As to Nagoya, Wakayama and Mito [known now as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
Owarri, Kii and Mito, the San kay, or “three families,”
sons of Iyeyas], and the fifteen Kammong, the heir must
always be the eldest son, and the territory of each cannot
be divided among two or three sons.</p>

<p>* Daimios with incomes of 100,000 koku, and the Roshin
or Gorojiu, and officers upon outside business, and all captains
of the guards, are to be of the same rank as Kokushu.</p>

<p>* In regard to Fudai and Tozamma, and wealthy retainers
of Daimios (Byshings and Karo), in going from and returning
to Yedo they must observe the laws of the road, and
they are not to make their trains very splendid or very poor—<i>i.e.</i>,
a man of large income is not to go with a very splendid
train, neither is a man with small income to go with a
very meager retinue; and they are not, as if they were
puffed up, and to show their military power, to give trouble
to the hotels, or oppress the coolies and porters on the road.
This is to be notified to Daimios each time they come to
Yedo.</p>

<p>* As to ships, the sea, rivers, roads, porters, horses, the
rates are now all settled for greater or shorter distances, and
also as to weights to be carried; but all government carriage
is to be done with the greatest expedition, regardless of
expense.</p>

<p>* All San kin (those Daimios officially resident in Yedo)
are to make a present (or rather pay a tax) to the Gorogiu,
and to the under officers of state. Those whose incomes exceed
10,000 koku are to give gold, or kin badai—<i>i.e.</i>, gold
instead of a horse; if below 10,000 koku, they give silver
(gin badai) to each of the high officers. Wealthy Daimios,
with large official incomes, are to give much, those with
small incomes are to give little. This money the Gorogiu
is to appropriate to the expenses of the office.</p>

<p>* Among the servants of the Shiogoon are those who
have much ability and influence, and those who have little
of either; they are to act together, and mutually to assist
one another. By this means the government will work
smoothly. Men must be divided according to their abilities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
and dispositions, but they must be rewarded or punished
according to their actions.</p>

<p>* When I built the Danring (eighteen temples) before
mentioned, I put, <i>or</i> I made them, San mong (hill-doors).
[The San mong temple of Hiyay san near Miako is a copy
of the Tien Tai shan of China.] The Ten dai no zass (head
of the Buddhists) asked me why I had built these San mong
or hill-doors, saying that he was the same as the center of
heaven, and had his seat upon the three stars (San tai say,
three sets of stars). I returned no answer. Now it is my
wish that long life may be given to the Mikado (10,000
years); therefore in the sixty-six provinces I built seventy-three.
I have written in a book the names and numbers of
these temples, and have sent this to the temple of Ten dai
san (in Miako), therefore be it known that no other San
mong temple is to be built.—This San mong must allude to
some kind of Buddhist temples of that name.</p>

<p>* All oo rin kay (military) officers and others under the
Shiogoon have since the time of Kamakura dono (Yoritomo)
received a commission from the Mikado. All these are under
the commands of the Shiogoon. The business is the same
as that of the Jin nee kang, office of the gods in old time.
Therefore, when a death occurs in my palace, or among
those who come to my residence (<i>i.e.</i>, Yedo), the customs
of the Jin nee kang are to be observed.—The custom is to
consider, when a death takes place in a house, all connected
with it as temporarily unclean. In the Emperor’s family
women at certain times move to another house; when a
child is born, the father and mother are considered unclean
for a time, and cannot go to office or to a temple; when a
death takes place, persons entering a house either do not
take off their shoes, or put on others for the purpose, and
there should be neither smoking, eating, nor drinking in the
house for three days.</p>

<p>* If a man neglects his duties and gives himself up to
gambling and drinking, and thinks that because he is of
rank he may do so, and so seduce others beneath him to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
same practices; if such a one has not been taught that such
conduct is wrong by his teacher, it shall be considered the
teacher’s crime; but if he has been taught, he himself shall
be considered the offender, and dealt with accordingly; but
in these offenses there are great differences in degree, and
some are to be punished severely, others lightly.</p>

<p>* Men are prone to become indolent and lazy at work,
and in consequence become thieves, breaking the laws and
occasioning trouble; all these must be severely punished by
death; and if any one sets houses on fire, forges seals or signatures,
poisons, coins false money—such shall be either
burned alive or be speared on a cross.</p>

<p>* A government can easily gather information as to
what men do in their business, but as to what they think
in their hearts it is more difficult. Kamakura dono, in reference
to this, followed the customs of the Tong dynasty of
China, and had recourse to informers, offering rewards to
such as should give information as to evil-disposed persons.</p>

<p>* In regard to the Go koku, or five grains—<i>i.e.</i>, grain of
every kind—if these are not abundant, the way of the government
of the Emperor is obscure. If crime abounds, the
Shiogoon shows himself destitute of executive energy. He
himself must be active and diligent in his own duties.</p>

<p>* The higher men (? nobility) make the laws, and the
lower classes follow and obey; but it is sometimes difficult
to act up to the rules laid down, therefore men of rank are
not to order one thing and do another themselves, but are to
take care that they carry out what they profess, and observe
the laws which they lay down.</p>

<p>* In regard to Kokushu (territorial princes, or lords of a
province) and Jo shiu (larger Daimios), if they act in such
a way as if not to amount to crime, still may be deserving
of censure, they cannot be punished personally, but they are
to be ordered to carry out some expensive undertaking for
the benefit of the country.—Such as making a fort; that at
Kanagawa was thus made by Oki no kami.</p>

<p>* Upon the death of the Kinri (the Emperor), or Sento<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
(retired Emperor), or the Emperor’s wife or near relative,
all music and shows of pleasure are to cease for a time. If
one of the San ko (either the Oo- or Sa- or Nai-daijin) dies,
or the Dai shiogoon, notice shall be given of how many days
this cessation shall be.—Mourning for the Emperor lasts for
thirteen months.</p>

<p>* When a new Emperor ascends the throne, the expenses
are all to be undertaken by me, the Shiogoon, and in these I
must be liberal.</p>

<p>* If any representative of a foreign nation comes to the
country, the officers must take care that everything is in
good order—that horses and horse-furniture be good, the
houses and roads clean. If they are dirty, it can be seen at
a glance whether the nation is prosperous or the reverse.</p>

<p>* If a foreign vessel should be wrecked on the shore of
Japan, the officers of government are to be immediately informed,
and an interpreter is to be sent to ask what they
require. Sometimes the officers may require to be strict and
severe, at other times hospitable and kind. The vessel is to
be watched, and no trading allowed.</p>

<p>* It is said that the Mikado, looking down on his people,
loves them as a mother does her children. The same may
be said of me and of my government. This benevolence of
mind is called Jin. This Jin may be said to consist of five
parts; these are humanity, integrity, courtesy, wisdom and
truth. Therefore I have divided the government into Tozamma,
Fudai, Shing and Sso. This mode of government
is according to the way of heaven. This I have done to
show that I am impartial, and am not assisting my own
relations and friends only. Between the Shing and Sso it
is improper that there should be any communications, and
therefore they are not to be in correspondence with each other.</p>

<p>* If punishments and rewards are distributed unjustly,
upright men will disappear. The people will become timid
and niggardly. Therefore it is of the utmost importance
that there be not the smallest act of injustice committed by
government officers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>These laws have not been made recently by me, but have
existed from generation to generation in the Minnamoto
family. What I have written is like a reflection in a mirror.
The arrow, if it does not pierce the bull’s-eye, will perhaps
strike the target.</p>

<p>Old customs must, when found good on examination, be
retained.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The principles and sentiments, and at times the very
words of these laws, seem to be taken from the writings of
the old sages of China, Confucius and Mencius. Confucius,
in the Chung yung, seems to have been the model after
which the code was drawn up. It is founded upon the five
duties of universal obligation—that of a sovereign and minister,
of a father and son, of husband and wife, of elder and
younger brothers, and between friends; and upon the principle
that the administration of government lies in getting
proper men, and that such are to be obtained by means of
the ruler’s own character.</p>

<p>The idea of turning to look inward and examine one’s
self is prominent in the writings of Mencius.</p>

<p>Mencius said people have this common saying—“The
empire, the state, the family. The root of the empire is the
state—the root of the state is in the family—the root of
the family is in the person of its head.” And Iyeyas seems
to have recognized these principles as the foundation of his
rule, believing that when too much weight is given to the
state, despotism ensues; when the family preponderates,
oligarchy of an aristocracy prevails; and where the interests
of the individual man become paramount, democracy rears
its head.</p>

<p>Those who framed the code were in all probability acquainted
with the writings of the Chinese sages and their
commentators, and perhaps they refer, in the allusions to
Kamakura dono or Yoritomo, to some laws laid down by
him or his officers, who had more opportunity of studying
the Chinese writings than could fall to the lot of men who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
had been brought up in the troublous times when Iyeyas
was a youth.</p>

<p>The consideration of such laws laid down by Iyeyas, and
which are more or less still in force, leads to a comparison
with the condition of Europe during the time when feudal
institutions were in force, the genius of these laws being in
many respects the counterpart of that which was in force
in Europe in feudal times. The constitution of all warlike
nations in early times has tended to this condition. The
discoveries of gunpowder and printing have been the great
means of breaking down this system; and in our day steam
is rapidly breaking up what these had left.</p>

<p>The man to whom had been given the most capacity for
dealing with men and for conducting war, was selected to
take the command of those who saw these qualities in him,
and confided in his ability to prosecute any undertaking to a
successful termination. Of necessity such a man must be
a soldier. He must have the capacity to govern as well as
to fight; to make laws as well as to lead in battle; to conciliate
men as well as to control them. He divides the spoils
among his followers, allowing to each a proportion according
to his merit.</p>

<p>A larger portion was retained by the chief, because, independently
of being able to appropriate it, he was to rule over
all, and to incur expenses on behalf of all in the general control
of the acquired territory.</p>

<p>This chief generally retained in his own hand certain
privileges, such as a more or less controlling voice in the
legislature, power of life and death, and of making peace
or war and treaties of commerce, coinage of money, right
of property in mines of gold and silver, and other rights.
He had the power of conferring some of these on the barons
holding land from him and under him as superior. By subdivision
a feudal kingdom was cut up into many small but
semi-independent baronies. The execution of legal decisions
became difficult, offenders escaping to other jurisdictions.</p>

<p>Through the greater expenses falling upon the king, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
power often waned, while that of the barons waxed greater;
and to render their independence perpetual, and at the same
time to assure a support to the chief, the system of entail
was fallen upon.</p>

<p>The barons were ever and again adding to their property
and power by marriages, by successions, by purchase, or by
force and might. Honors and even offices became hereditary.</p>

<p>So long as weapons of war were in each man’s possession,
and every one was in proportion to his personal strength and
activity a soldier, no great expense fell upon the chief. His
followers could be summoned at an hour’s notice.</p>

<p>But when the introduction of gunpowder rendered personal
strength and activity of comparatively small value, it
increased the expense falling upon the leader. Trained skill
required time, and education was necessary. Large guns,
requiring expensive ammunition, called for a more expensive
system of fortification. The lesser barons could not
undertake these. The expenses of war fell entirely upon the
king. Trained soldiers required a standing army. When
there is any coast to defend, a navy is required.</p>

<p>In the practical working of the system of Iyeyas, there
was the difference between Japan and European countries,
that, until the use of steam, she had no neighbors to dread
as foes or to covet as vassals. There was always an attempt
to compensate for the want of this external pressure in the
duality or separation of interests between the Mikado, the
fountain of honors, and the executive, by whatever name
the head officer might be called, whether Kwanrei or Shiogoon.</p>

<p>Security was sought for by the laws of Iyeyas, not against
external foes, but against the decadence of the dynasty from
internal weakness, or from the power of those who ought to
be supporters becoming overwhelming. There was in Japan
no call for great expenses, either in keeping up fortifications,
armaments, or a standing army or navy. No embassadors
were dispatched to foreign courts, to consume the
revenues of the empire. Against the tendency to the aggrandizement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
of the barons, and their increase in wealth and
power by marriage and other means, Iyeyas fixed the amount
of territory which each lord was to possess. Land which
produced of rice annually a certain quantity was allotted to
each baron, according to his rank or rights. But one great
difference between this system and that of entails in Europe
lay in this, that the estate granted to each baron could not
be added to or diminished, either by marriage or by purchase
or by might, except by express permission and grant from
the Shiogoon, the superior of all. This law tended to prevent
the enormous accumulation of land in a few hands.
This land they might lease or grant to their retainers, some
of whom were very wealthy; but so long as such a one was
a retainer of a Daimio, whatever his wealth might be, there
was little chance of his rising to honors in the state.</p>

<p>The barons in Japan are bound to bring a certain number
of men to assist the lord superior in war. Each of these
followers is paid by the baron by so much land producing a
certain quantity of rice.</p>

<p>Succession to these lands is hereditary, but not strictly to
the eldest son, while the custom so common over the East
of adoption is allowed, and all the rights of a son are conferred
upon the adopted one. Many of the present Daimios
are adopted children—frequently no relative whatever of
the person who so adopts. But while Iyeyas declared that
these fiefs should be hereditary, he at the same time laid it
down as a principle that it was good that these lesser lords
should not remain too long in one place, but that, when
occasion seemed to require it, it was well to change them
from one barony to another. He would no doubt have gladly
laid down a similar principle as to the Kokushu, or lords of
provinces, but their power and influence were too great to be
lightly interfered with. This power has been frequently put
forth down to the present time. A Daimio with an income
of 10,000 koku is ordered to remove to the territory of another
with the same revenue; or perhaps, if there be some
cause for reproof, a Daimio will be transferred to a territory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
in the far north, such as Tanagura, and the baron then living
there, who may be the son of one who had been similarly
deported, is removed to the better locality.</p>

<p>Iyeyas provided for the payment of stated presents on
arrival at Yedo. At other times gifts are made to the Shiogoon;
and, as under the feudal system, presents are to be
offered on other occasions, such as marriage or becoming
of age.</p>

<p>The civil authority of the Shiogoon was liable to much
limitation, and this Iyeyas seems to have expected. At first
an officer was deputed by the Shiogoon to reside in the territories
of the greater barons, and to report to Yedo when he
saw anything taking place worthy of animadversion. But
this has been done away with, and the Kokushu are virtually
in full possession of power, each in his own provincial
territory.</p>

<p>Under the laws above recited the men of the country are
divided into four classes—the gentry, agriculturists, artisans,
and merchants. The gentry are separated from the other
classes by the distinctive badge of wearing a long sword,
which they are warned never to forget. By this sword the
class is distinguished over the whole empire. But the class
is again subdivided by the respective badges, shields or coats-of-arms
of the chiefs worn prominently on some part of the
dress—generally on the back and on each breast.</p>

<p>The right of wearing two swords brings with it privileges
which may be looked upon as means of paying the class—somewhat
as purveyance under the feudal laws of England
conveyed privileges, which were gained generally at the expense
of the agricultural class along the highroads. Under
these laws all two-sworded men are allowed to demand carriage
for themselves and goods along the highway at a much
lower rate than others, and this naturally ends in paying
nothing. Their goods are permitted to enter towns free of
customs, or at much-reduced rates. Such privileges become
in time very irksome to the class which has to pay for them.</p>

<p>While a Daimio is not permitted to add to his territories<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
by purchase or marriage, these may be increased at the will
and by the favor of the Shiogoon, or they may be diminished
by his fiat. While, if any officer has been thought deserving
of a little punishment, he may be desired to build a fort or a
bridge, or make a road, or do something which shall benefit
the country, and at the same time act as a pecuniary fine
upon the person upon whom the honor is conferred.—The
fort at Kanagawa was built in this way.</p>

<p>One of the strongest measures of control used by the
Shiogoon toward the barons is put forward when they have
been known to be intriguing against their superiors. This is
sometimes carried out without trial or previous step of any
kind, and consists in the intimation to the lord that he is to
divest himself of the insignia of rank, hand over the power
which he holds as a Daimio to some other individual (generally
a near relative and a minor), and confine himself to
one room until further orders. Such an intimation would
probably not be given unless the government were sure of its
ground. But the power consists in the position in which his
own retainers stand toward their lord. If he, upon receiving
such a notice, obeys it at once, no other changes take place;
the individual is simply removed out of the way, and the
offices are transferred to his successor. The wealthy and
powerful vassals remain, with their property, unaffected by
the step. But should he presume to offer resistance, and
rise in rebellion, all the retainers suffer with him. They
will all be, in case of the failure of the rebellion, deprived
of their territories, which will be taken from them and given
to others. It is therefore the interest of all those about a
Daimio that he should obey a sentence which they all have
an idea he more or less deserved. All those about him,
therefore, insist upon his abdication; and he, feeling himself
alone and forsaken, is obliged quietly to yield, and thus
trouble to the whole province is averted. But in the case
where the retainers believe that the cause of their master is
a right one, and that he has the power as well as the ability
to defend himself, they will rally round him, and defy even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
the highest government. This took place in the case of
Choshiu against the Shiogoon; while the cases of Satsuma,
Owarri, and others, who were deposed by the regent in
1858, show how the power is at times exercised.</p>

<p>As a further means of warding off intrigue and plotting
among these powerful and wealthy barons, the plan was
adopted by which all were brought to the court of the Shiogoon,
as inferiors or vassals, to pay homage. The custom
among these vassals of paying their respects once a year had
been long in use in an unsettled and desultory way at Miako,
but henceforth Iyeyas insisted upon each Daimio visiting his
capital of Yedo at certain periods, fixed in proportion to the
distance of his territory. And he further insisted that his
court should be looked upon as the natural residence of these
lords, by their having their wives and families always resident
in Yedo. And it was this law which rendered such
stringent measures to be taken at Hakonay and other gates
to prevent the passage outward of females. By this constant
moving of the Daimios to and fro between Yedo and
the provinces, money was circulated; large sums were spent
in Yedo on the establishments they kept up there, and large
sums were spent on the way and at the residence of each in
his own province.</p>

<p>Iyeyas seems further to have been jealous of any intercourse
being carried on between these Daimios one with another,
and in these laws measures are taken to prevent this
as much as possible. The different classes of Daimios met
in different rooms in his castle, and one of one class is not
allowed to go into the meeting-room of another.</p>

<p>All these compulsory measures of vassalage in Yedo have
tended to keep up in the Daimios a feeling of inferiority to
the family in power, and are liable, when the influence of
this family wanes, to become very irksome.</p>

<p>The general features of the country help with these aids
to keep the power in the hands of one man or family. The
number of islands, and the length and narrowness of the
island of Nippon, divided as it is by a mountainous ridge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
prevent intercommunication being kept up or leagues being
formed between contiguous proprietors.</p>

<p>It is the duty of one set of officers at the court of Yedo to
inform each Daimio when he is to come to the capital, and
it is probably their care to see that the owners of contiguous
properties shall not be at the same time at their respective
country-seats.</p>

<p>Many of these customs had been in use in the empire
during the rule of those who had preceded Iyeyas; but he
seems to have gathered what he thought good, and strengthened
what seemed weak, so as to provide a firm basis on
which to place his dynasty, and inclose it with safeguards
that should resist attacks from the restless and warlike men
upon whose shoulders his seat had been raised.</p>

<p>With the wish natural to a great administrator, Iyeyas
settled all the offices about his court for the good government
of the empire. These are mentioned above; but as
these offices require a more minute mention, they are given
more in detail below. These rules run over a large ground
in their dealings with or allusions to all ranks and relations.</p>

<p>Except in the cases of high treason or open rebellion, the
families of the feudal barons were not to be attainted. Primogeniture
and male succession were encouraged as much
as possible, and adoption of heirs sanctioned even during
early youth, and sons so adopted can be returned.</p>

<p>The higher Daimios were not allowed to take office or to
have any part in the government, except by giving their
opinion when asked.</p>

<p>The Board or Parliament, where all officers on duty in
Yedo met for discussion and consultation on general business
(the Hio josho), was settled.</p>

<p>The punishment of crimes was modified, and the old cruel
modes of death done away with. Clemency toward enemies
was urged as the proper method of gaining them over.</p>

<p>Recreations for all men were allowed and approved of as
useful both to body and spirit.</p>

<p>Reverence toward the Emperor was inculcated by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
example of the Shiogoon, and by advice to the high officers
about the court.</p>

<p>The high-priest at Yedo was to be appointed from a near
relative of the Emperor, in order that, if there should be a
party siding with the Emperor, the Shiogoon might have a
rival of the family in his own hands and interest.</p>

<p>The exemption from civil and criminal jurisdiction claimed
by the priesthood, and in which they were strongly backed
up by the Roman Catholic priests, was abolished. A tendency
to the idea that the priesthood, and priests as individuals,
were hedged in by a divinity, which gave them a
license for the committal and an immunity from the punishment
of crimes, was pointed out as an evil to be guarded
against.</p>

<p>Gentlemen having the right to wear two swords were
to consider such an honorable responsibility.</p>

<p>The empire was surveyed and good maps were made of
every district.</p>

<p>The power of judging of what was insolence from an inferior
to a superior, and the power of punishing it, were
given, in a rather unguarded way, to individuals.</p>

<p>Marriage was encouraged, and placed upon the footing
of its being the way of heaven that one man should have
one wife.</p>

<p>The reverence to be shown toward father, mother, elder
brothers, and teachers is put forth upon the old Chinese
views, and the relations of master and servant are in like
manner treated of.</p>

<p>The military position of the country, the passes through
the hills, and dangers, are all alluded to. The strategical
positions about Yedo are noticed.</p>

<p>Roads come under regulation, and the building of farm-houses.</p>

<p>The government is considered as bound to do its best to
provide cheap food for the people. Mourning for the Emperor,
religious sects, foreigners, prostitution, suicide—all
come in for recognition in the Bookay Hiak Kadjo.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>THE POSITION AND COURT OF THE SHIOGOON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the above code Iyeyas laid down the order of rank in
which the officers about him or under him should move.
The offices were probably more or less settled and in existence
during the rule of Taikosama and of Nobu nanga, and
of the ministers who had filled a somewhat analogous office
during many generations at Kamakura.</p>

<p>The head of this Yedo system, as it may be called, is the
Shiogoon, the commander-in-chief or head of the military
department of the empire, under which is included the police
and financial departments.</p>

<p>From the account of the court of the Mikado, as given in
a previous chapter, it is to be gathered that the Mikado is the
chief ruler over the empire. To him the whole empire looks
up with reverence; from him flows the stream of honors conferred
upon subjects—all equally his servants.</p>

<p>After the royal family (the Shinwo), the highest subject
is the Kwanbakku, who is at the head of the five highest
families of Koongays. After these follow the other Koongay
families in order, down to the lowest and poorest enrolled in
the peerage of the empire.</p>

<p>Beneath all this court, and standing upon a lower platform,
is the court of the Shiogoon, at the head of which is the
Shiogoon, the commander-in-chief of the army, and around
him the Kami or Daimio class, who receive and hold their
territory from him as viceroy for the Emperor. The words
Shio goon were derived in early times from the Chinese.
Tsiang kiun is the title of the general commanding one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
the divisions of the army in China.—In ancient times in
Japan the title of the commander-in-chief was Mono nobe.</p>

<p>The past history of the empire has shown that the Emperor
himself was originally the leader or commander-in-chief
of his own armies, but that in course of time the office
was conferred upon one of the younger members of the imperial
family. It was afterward transferred to the man who
in a lawless revolutionary period showed himself capable of
seizing and holding the command of the army. Thus Yoritomo
held it, and so it afterward became hereditary in the
Ashikanga family, until the last of these died out a few
years before Iyeyas achieved the object of his ambition.</p>

<p>In any consideration of the government of Japan and its
relations, it is necessary to have clear ideas of the position in
which the Emperor and the Shiogoon stand to one another.
A reference to the history of the country, as given above,
may in some measure explain these; but it may not be without
use to state briefly what is the position of the Shiogoon.</p>

<p>The Japanese generally are imbued with the idea that
their land is a real Shin koku, a Kami no kooni; that is, the
land of spiritual beings or kingdom of spirits. They are led
to think that the Emperor rules over all, and that among
other subordinate powers he rules over the spirits of the
country. He rules over men, and is to them the fountain
of honor; and this is not confined to honors in this world, but
is extended to the other, where they are advanced from rank
to rank by the orders of the Emperor. The doctrine of the
divine right is carried perhaps further than it ever was in
England, though, after all, he is probably only regarded as
“that sanctified person who, under God, is the author of our
true happiness.” He confers rank upon the officers of the
empire, and from him Nobu nanga, Taikosama and Iyeyas
received whatever rank each held in the empire. By the
death of the last of the Ashikanga Shiogoons the opportunity
presented itself of giving the title to one who had earned
it, and it was given to Iyeyas.</p>

<p>The name by which the Shiogoon of the present day is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
known to foreigners is that of Tycoon; there is, however,
no such title as Tycoon in the language of Japan. The two
words Tai kiun are Chinese, signifying “the great prince,
sovereign, or exalted ruler,” implying that the bearer of the
title is the great sovereign or ruler of Japan. Such a title
conveys an idea of superiority over all in the empire which
is not conveyed by any of the native titles given to or assumed
by the Shiogoon. The title is of foreign growth, and
the assumption has been looked upon with great jealousy
by the Mikado.</p>

<p>By the old Jesuit writers, the head of the executive
was frequently spoken of as the Emperor, the Kubosama,
the Xogune, etc. There was, indeed, in their case, some
difficulty, as of the three Iyeyas alone was Shiogoon, and
that toward the end of his life. Kubosama, as has been
stated elsewhere, was a title of respect given by the Emperor
to the first Ashikanga. It was given to him after he had
given up the title of Shiogoon, and it is somewhat inconsistent
to use them together.</p>

<p>The title used by the Mikado to the Shiogoon is Tai jiu,
“the large tree”; and this is probably the best name that
could be used by foreigners in speaking of him, or in addressing
him officially. That used by the Daimios in addressing
him is Rioo ay, or “the green tent.”</p>

<p>The son and heir of the Tai jiu, whether his father be
alive or not, till he is fifteen years of age, goes by the name
of Takke cheoo, two Chinese words meaning a bamboo shoot
of a thousand years. He generally assumes the <i>toga virilis</i>
(the ceremony known as Gembuku) when he is about fifteen;
but if he is called to the succession as a child, this may take
place at an earlier period, or about eight or ten, when he has
his head shaved as a man and takes his man-name, by which
he is thenceforth known.</p>

<p>There is a civil title which the present dynasty has been
proud to assume as patrons of learning; namely, the head
or rector of the two principal colleges of the empire, June
wa and Shoongaku drio in no bettowo, implying that he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
the principal patron or rector of the two colleges of June wa
and Shoongaku. This title is assumed as his being the “Genji
no choja”; <i>i.e.</i>, the head of the Gen or Minnamoto family.
He may be spoken of as Minnamoto no choja—as such he
considers himself as the first of all the military families of
the empire. These titles he assumes, and they may be called
family and literary honors. So soon as he has passed the
ceremony of Gembuku, the Emperor confers rank and title
upon him; these are civil and military, and also of rank or
position. The lowest civil rank given to him is probably
Dai nagoon, from which he is raised to Naidaijin, Oodaijin,
and Sadaijin, and may be raised to the highest, Daijodaijin;
but this is generally reserved for the Kwanbakku. The military
rank given him is Shiogoon, to which the prefix Dai,
“great,” may or may not be added. The Dai Shiogoon is
the commander-in-chief of the army, and being, to a certain
extent, looked upon as hereditary, is only an honorary title.
To this title is sometimes added the two words Se i (Ching
i of the Chinese), the chastiser or tranquilizer of the barbarians
or of foreigners; <i>i.e.</i>, outside people at a distance from
court. This title was originally given with reference to the
conquest of the Ai nos in the north of Japan and Yezo; but
it has lately been applied to foreigners by the Mikado in his
dispatches, as when he says, “I have given you the title of
Se i; why do you not fulfill the expectations which I had
of you?” Se i fhoo, the office of the pacifier of barbarians,
is one of the names applied to the castle of Yedo.</p>

<p>Over and above these the Mikado denotes his place in the
ranks of the nobility, as that he is of the second grade, first
or second class.</p>

<p>The titles of Iyeyas were Jin itchi-i, first of the second
grade.—Oodaijin, the great minister of the right.—Se i dai
Shiogoon, tranquilizer of foreigners and great commander-in-chief.—June
wa, Shoongaku drio in no bettowo, principal
of the two colleges of June wa and Shoongaku.—Genji no
choja, the head of the Gen clan.—Minnamoto no Iyeyas.</p>

<p>The name of Daifusama, by which the Jesuits spoke of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
Iyeyas, is a corruption of Naidaijin, as Nai foo sama, or,
according to the subsequent use of sama, lord of the inner
office.</p>

<p>The Shiogoon adopts a crest or coat-of-arms differing
from that in use by the Mikado. It is called awui, or a
representation of three leaves of a species of mallow, “awui,”
joined at the points and inclosed in a circle. This is used in
all official matters issuing from the office. No one is allowed
to use it but those who are relatives of the Shiogoon, or upon
business emanating from the office.</p>

<p>Iyeyas took up his residence at Yedo, in the castle which
had been built at a former period by Owota do kwang, and
which was formerly known by the name Tchi oda, and is at
times still so called. Large sums of money were expended
upon this residence. It was increased greatly in size. A
deep trench or moat was dug round it, cutting it off from
communication, except by the gates, with the town. This
trench or moat was and is kept filled by a canal drawn off
from the Rokungo kawa, near the village of Omaro, about
nine miles from Yedo. At Miako the castle of Nijio Maro
is his residence.</p>

<p>At Osaka, the large castle, formerly the temple of Hoonganji,
and the residence of Buddhist priesthood, afterward
converted into a castle or fort by Taikosama, is in possession
of the Shiogoon.</p>

<p>At Surunga, the castle formerly belonging to Imagawa
is kept up at his expense.</p>

<p>In Kahi, the castle of Kofu, formerly the property of Takeda,
is another residence, while in different provinces there
are minor seats or residences occupied by retainers and officers.</p>

<p>Iyeyas was buried at Nikko san, where a magnificent temple
was reared in his honor, to which repair at certain times
his descendants and the officers of the dynasty to pay reverence
to his names, to commemorate his greatness, or in the
way of official duty.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE DAIMIOS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the above laws Iyeyas speaks of Daimios and Shomios,
among whom the territories at his disposal were to be divided.
The division was made in the ratio of twenty millions to the
Daimios to eight millions which he reserved to himself.
“Daimio” is compounded of two Chinese words, signifying
“great name”; “Shomio” is “little name.” The latter
title has fallen into disuse, and is generally replaced by
Hattamoto, meaning “the root or foundation of the flag.”
The Daimio class may be considered to include every officer
who holds directly of the Shiogoon, and has an official income
from land held of the Shiogoon of the annual value of
10,000 koku of rice and upward. The real value of a koku
is difficult to ascertain, as it varies much at different times,
whether it be looked upon as a measure of rice or as a coin—a
kobang, as it is commonly reckoned. Of 4 kobangs assayed
by the United States mint the variation was from 3
dollars 57 cents to 5 dollars 95 cents, or from 15s. to 24s.
10,000 koku are considered equal to 25,000 piculs of rice, or
nearly 4,000,000 pounds. There are many men whose incomes
are upward of 10,000 koku, but who do not hold their
land of the Shiogoon, but of some Daimio. Such are not
Daimios, but servants or retainers of a Daimio, known sometimes
as “By shing.”</p>

<p>The offices and officers of the court of the Shiogoon have
continued, with but little change, from the time of Iyeyas
down to the opening of the country in 1858. The order
in which these officers took rank was settled by Iyeyas; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
the offices seem to have been more or less in use during
the time of his predecessor Taikosama, and had probably
existed for many years. Iyeyas in his laws did not for a
moment contemplate any interference with the court of the
Emperor. That was above him. The lowest Koongay of
that court was above him until the Emperor should have
conferred upon himself some title of rank.</p>

<p>The nobility of the Emperor’s court are all Koongay.
Their names are enrolled in the Great Book of the Empire
as enjoying patents of nobility, while the names of Daimios
as such are not so enrolled. As Daimios they are not nobles
of the empire. Daimios (literally Ta meng), or feudal lords
(Chu haou), are, in contradistinction to Koongay, called Jee
ngay (Ti hia). The former means “noble families,” the
latter meaning low, on a level with the earth. The Shiogoon
himself is Jee ngay until he has been ennobled by the Emperor.
Till recently, Daimios, except the few whose presence
was required upon duty, were not permitted to visit
Miako. Even when they received rank and title from the
Emperor, a relative was sent to pay homage.</p>

<p>Iyeyas, as head of the executive, dealt with these Daimios
and Hattamoto, or lesser barons, only. Among them there
are recognised four classes; viz., Koku shiu, Ka mong, To
sama, and Fudai. The highest class—Koku shiu (Kwoh
chu)—“province lords,” were those whose ancestors had been
in possession of large territories, and who in several cases
opposed Iyeyas in arms, yet whom he thought it safer to
conciliate than to irritate, looking upon them as more on
an equality with himself than the others. About the time of
Iyeyas there were seventeen of these province lords, to which
number four have since been added. The second class—Ka
mong (Kia mun), family doors or gates—consisted of relatives
of his family who had assisted him in his rise to power,
and upon whom he conferred territory. If the “San kay,”
or three families of his own line, be included, there were ten
Ka mong. The third class—To sama (Wai yang)—were
those who, being no relatives or connections, were possessed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
of considerable landed property, and who sided with Iyeyas
during his struggle for power. The fourth—the Fudai (P’u
tai)—includes the officers, retainers, captains of his army, or
those who in civil capacities, but subordinate, assisted him.
Of this Daimio class there are about 200. Fudai are the
only Daimios who are eligible for office, or who are allowed
to take a part in official business. In rare cases To sama
have given up their rank and privileges in order to participate
and take an active part in official politics.</p>

<p>The being a Daimio or Kooni kami implies that the officer
belongs to one of these four classes, and has an annual income
from land, as has been said, of 10,000 koku of rice.</p>

<p>The standing of Daimios as a distinct nobility is not recognized
at Miako, and it is therefore an object of ambition
to them to obtain imperial honors at the hand of the Emperor,
such honors being looked upon as much higher than
the names by which they are known at the court of the
Shiogoon, and which are conferred by him. These latter
are invariably the name of a province, of which each is
styled “kami.” There are three provinces from which titles
as kami are never taken by Daimios: Kadsusa, Fitatsi, and
Kowotsuki; these provinces as a title being reserved for the
relatives of the Emperor. This gives rise, as mentioned before,
to the distinction between titles as Kooni kami and
those known as Kio kwang. These latter titles are much
coveted, and a great deal of money is expended and interest
employed in endeavoring to obtain a title from the Emperor.
If an officer has both descriptions of titles, the Kio kwang
always takes precedence, as in the case of Satsuma: he is a
Koku shiu and a Kooni kami, as such he has the title of
Ohosumi, or Satsuma no kami; but he is rarely so spoken
of. Holding the imperial title of Shuri no dai bu, he is
known by this added to his family name, Shimadzu, Shuri
no dai bu—<i>i.e.</i>, Shimadzu, head of the ecclesiastical carpenters’
office. In addition to these designations from provinces
by which Daimios are generally known, the Shiogoon has
thought to confer higher honor upon some, and to attach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
them more to his family and its interests, by giving them
permission to use his family name. The name of the parent
stock is Tokungawa, but the branch to which Iyeyas belonged
was known as Matzdaira (a village in Mikawa).
When the ruling officer is powerful, these lords are proud
to use this name; when he is insignificant, they avoid it.
Thus the lord of the western provinces of Nippon uses at
times the family name of Mowori, at other times he is Matzdaira,
Daizen no dai bu.</p>

<p>The higher class of the lords (the Koku shiu), who generally
rule over one or more provinces, are frequently called
by the name of one of the provinces as spoken according to
the Chinese pronunciation of the character. Thus Mowori
is ruler over the province of Nagato; <i>i.e.</i>, long gate or entrance—in
Chinese, Chang mun, Japanized into Cho mong.
The latter word is dropped, and instead of it “shiu,” or province,
is added—whence Cho shiu, the name by which he is
frequently spoken of. Satsuma is thus Sas shiu, Owarri,
Bishiu, etc.</p>

<p>One difficulty in completely understanding the use of the
various titles in Japan arises from a confusion in the application
of the word “kami.” As a title, this word is conferred
by the Emperor and the Shiogoon. The word, when
conferred by the Shiogoon, is the Chinese character “shau,”
with the meaning of keeper, or to take charge of. Used in
this way, the name of a province is invariably prefixed, as
Yamato no kami. And as the names of the provinces are
known as our counties are with us, the title is at once understood
by a native. But this is quite a different word from
that found in the title of Ee Kamong no kami. This is an
imperial title. The Chinese character representing this word
is that of “tau,” or head, and implies that he is the head of
a department; viz., that which takes charge of the verandas
and outside pathways about the palace. Again, the word
occurs in military titles, as Sa yay mong no kami. In such
a title the Chinese character “tuh,” meaning to keep, to
lead, or a general, is employed, implying that he is commander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
of the guards of the left gate. In a fourth instance
the Chinese character is “ching”—correct, to govern, or to
see that things are correct; and the word is found in such
titles as Oone me no kami, Oone me being the department
of the female officers about the palace. It is therefore evident
that the office must be known before the title can be
translated, and that the word prince will not give a correct
translation of “kami” when connected with such an office
as Gengba, which is the office for foreign affairs.</p>

<p>The term “tono” is still frequently applied to Daimios
by the common people, and is often conjoined with “sama,”
as Tonosama. It is the Chinese word “tien,” a palace or
hall, and was originally conferred upon the crown prince of
China, and thence transferred to the son of the Kwanbakku.
The Portuguese writers frequently use “dono.” “Sama” is
the Chinese “yang,” and was at first conferred upon Ashikanga
yoshi haru when the Emperor for the first time gave
him the title of Kubosama. From this it passed as a title
of respect to other high officers, but has now become as common
as esquire in England. “Tono” in the same way is
now used by Hattamoto. “Yakatta” (Ch., kwan), a word
sometimes used by the Jesuits for Daimios, is properly restricted
to the castle of a Daimio, and is used only for the
more or less fortified residences of the more powerful of
the class.</p>

<p>The five hereditary orders of peerage used in China are
not known in Japan except by name (Ko, Ko, Haku, Shi,
and Dan). Of the Daimio class the Shiogoon is the head.</p>

<p>Of the present dynasty, if such it can be called, Iyeyas
was the first. He derived his descent, in his officially published
pedigree, from the Emperor Say wa, one of whose
descendants was Iyo no kami, Yori yoshi. His son was
Hatchimang Taro, Mootz no kami, Yoshi Iyay. He was
known in history as a great warrior, fighting in the province
of Mootz for twelve years. His third son was Siki bu no
Ta yu, Yoshi kooni, the founder of the families of Nitta and
Ashikanga. His son was Nitta, Oee no ske, Yisho shigay,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
commonly called Dai ko een (great light). His fourth son
was Yoshi Suyay, called Tokungawa shiro (<i>i.e.</i>, fourth son),
from whom was descended Minnamoto no Hirotada, the
father of Iyeyas, who was the eldest son. Iyeyas claimed
to be descended from the Nitta family. His grandfather
was adopted by Matzdaira Tarozayaymon, then a farmer
in Mikawa, at the village Matzdira.</p>

<p>I. Iyeyas had twelve children: 1. A daughter, married
Okudaira Mimasaka no kami. 2. A son, Nobu yas. His
father suspected him of intriguing against him and was said
to have killed him in Mikawa. In one of Mr. Cocks’ letters
he says, “It is said that the eldest son was disinherited on
account of his having lost his nose by disease.” 3. Etsizen
chiu nangoong, Hideyas. As a boy he was given to Taikosama,
and was adopted by him. After Taiko had a son, he
gave Hideyas in marriage to the heiress of the family of
Yuki, in Kadsusa, an old family; and after all the territory
was overrun and despoiled, his father gave to him the province
of Etsizen. 4. Hidetada ko married a daughter of
Taiko, and succeeded his father as Shiogoon. 5. Tada yoshi
ko, commonly called Matzdaira Satsuma no kami. He got
Kioss, in Owarri, a place formerly belonging to Nobu nanga.
6. Nobu noshi. 7. A daughter, married to Hojo Sagami no
kami. 8. A daughter, married first to Gamo Hida no kami
and secondly to Assano Tajima no kami. 9. Etsigo, Kadsusa
no ske Tadateru. 10. Owarri, Hioyay no kami, Yoshi nawo,
the founder of the line of Owarri—one of the “three families.”
11. Kii, Dainagoon, Hitatsi no ske, Yori yoshi, was
first of the Kii or Kiisiu line—one of the “three families.”
12. Mito, Chiunagoon, Sayaymong no kami, Yori fhoossa,
the first of the Mito line—one of the “three families.”</p>

<p>II. Hidetada, appointed Shiogoon in 1605, married the
daughter of Taikosama. He had nine children: 1. A daughter,
married Hideyori, the son of Taikosama. 2. A daughter,
married Komatzu. 3. A daughter, married the son of Etsizen,
the third son of Iyeyas. 4. A daughter, married Kiogoku.
5. A son, died in infancy. 6. Iyaymitz ko, the third<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
Shiogoon. 7. Tada naga. He intrigued to kill his brother
Iyaymitz, and, being detected, was confined to his room for
life. 8. A daughter, who married the Emperor Go midzuno.
9. Hoshima, Higo no kami, Massa yuki, founder of the family
now known as “Aidzu.”</p>

<p>III. Iyaymitz ko, appointed Shiogoon in 1623. He had
five children, of whom: 1. A daughter, married Owarri.
2. Iyaytsuna ko, the fourth Shiogoon of the dynasty. 3.
Kofu, Sama no Kami, Szna Shigay.</p>

<p>IV. Iyaytsuna ko, appointed Shiogoon in 1650. He was
said to have been killed by his wife, who was the daughter
of a vegetable seller, and had been employed as a servant
about the palace. Her father was given the wealth and
rank of a Daimio, as Matzdaira Hoki no kami. The family
crest was (in reference to the father’s occupation), and is
to this day, two Japanese turnips crossed. He left no
family.</p>

<p>V. Tsna yoshi ko, appointed 1680, was son of Kofu, Sama
no Kami. He had three children of whom: The second, a
daughter, married Kii, Tsunatoshi. 3. Iyay nobu ko, succeeded
as Shiogoon.</p>

<p>VI. Iyay nobu, appointed in 1710. He had three children:
1st and 2d were sons, who died young. The youngest
of the three was Iyay tsoongo ko, who was the seventh
Shiogoon.</p>

<p>VII. Iyay tsoongo, 1713. He had no children, and was
succeeded by a son of Kii Tsna toshi, who married the
daughter of the fifth Shiogoon.</p>

<p>VIII. Yoshi mone, 1716. During ten years of his youth
a regent held the reins. He is regarded as one of the most
able of the successors of Iyeyas. Is called, from his family,
Kiishiu Kubosama. He abdicated in 1745, and died in 1751.
He had four children, of whom: 1. Iyay shigay was the
ninth Shiogoon. 2. Moone taka was the founder of the Go
san kio family of Ta yass. 4. Moone kori kio. He is the
first of the Go san kio family of Stotsbashi.</p>

<p>IX. Iyay shigay ko, 1745. He had two sons: 1. Iyay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
haru ko, the tenth Shiogoon. 2. Shigay yoshi kio. He is
the first of the Go san kio family of Saymidzu.</p>

<p>X. Iyay haru ko, 1762. He had six children, of whom:
A daughter, died young. Another daughter married Owarri.
Iyay motu ko, who was called “half Shiogoon.” It is generally
believed that he was poisoned by his brother Iyay
nari. Iyay nari ko, who married a daughter of Satsuma.
And the sixth, a daughter, married Kii.</p>

<p>XI. Iyay nari ko, 1787. He had fifty-one children; but
as he was subject to epileptic fits, and weakly in mind and
body, he is not generally believed to have been the father of
many of them. Of his children: The 2d, a daughter, married
Owarri. The 3d was Iyay yoshi ko, the twelfth Shiogoon
of his line. The 11th, a daughter, married Mito. The
13th, a son, became Kii, Dainagoong. His son, Iyay muschi
ko, was Shiogoon in 1858 to 1866. The 17th, Asahime, married
Maizdaira, Etsizen no kami. The 26th, Ta yass, afterward
became Daimio of Owarri. The 28th, a daughter,
married to Matzdaira, Hizen no kami (Nabeshima). The
32d, a daughter, married to Kanga. The 34th, a son, Mikawa
no kami, known afterward as Kakudo sama. He
was adopted by Matzdaira Etsigo no kami, and was considered
a very able and judicious man, much respected.
A party wished, in 1858, to make him Shiogoon, but
he declined. He republished, for Japanese use, Kanghi’s
“Dictionary of the Chinese Language.” The 39th, a daughter,
married to Matzdaira, Aki no kami. The 41st, a daughter,
married Sakai, Oota no kami. The 42d, a daughter,
married Tokungawa, Mimboo kio. The 43d, a son, adopted
by Owarri. The 45th, a son, adopted by Kiishiu, and afterward
became Kii, Dainagoong. The 46th, a son, adopted
by Etsizen no kami. The 47th, a son, adopted by Awa no
kami. The 49th, Okura no tayu, adopted by Yamato no
kami. The 50th, Hiogo no tayu, adopted by Sahio yay
no kami. The other thirty-four children died in infancy
or childhood.</p>

<p>XII. Iyay yoshi ko, 1837. He had twenty-five children,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
of whom: The first six died in infancy. The 7th, Iyay sada
ko, succeeded him. The 9th, Tokungawa, Mimboo kio, was
adopted by Stotsbashi, one of the Go san kio, and he himself
afterward adopted a son of Mito, which son was, until
his abdication in 1867, the last Shiogoon of the dynasty.
The 21st, a daughter, married Arima, Naka tskasa no tayu.
The 25th married Mito. The rest all died in infancy.</p>

<p>XIII. Iyay sada ko, appointed in 1853. He had no sons.</p>

<p>XIV. Iyay mutchi ko, 1858, formerly Haru taka, son of
Kii, thirteenth child of the eleventh Shiogoon, succeeded to
the office. The death of Iyay sada without an heir was the
origin of much intrigue and trouble in the empire during
the year 1858. There were two claimants to the succession;
the one was the son of Mito, who had been adopted by Tokungawa,
Mimboo kio, the ninth son of the twelfth Shiogoon;
the other was the eldest surviving son of the eleventh
Shiogoon, who had been adopted by Kiishiu. It became,
therefore, a struggle between the two houses of Mito and
Kiishiu, and the regent sided with the latter. It was a
question between a son adopted out of the line and a youth
who had been adopted into the line. Iyay mutchi died in
1867, and was succeeded by Stotsbashi as Yoshi hissa, who
in his turn abdicated in 1868, and so the dynasty of Tokungawa
terminated.</p>

<p>It has been stated above that the offices about the court
of Yedo were all settled by Iyeyas. In his testamentary
rules he laid down the rank and order in which they were
to stand in the court. These may be here more particularly
described.</p>

<p>In the family of the Shiogoon, as given above, mention is
made of the San kay and of the San kio. The former name
means the three families, the latter the three princes of the
blood.</p>

<p>The “three families” referred to are the descendants of
the three youngest sons of Iyeyas—to the one of whom was
given the lordship of Owarri, to the other that of Kii, and to
the third that of Mito, a town and district in the province of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
Hitatsi. The heirs of these nobles stand at the top of the list
of Daimios, and from out of these families is chosen, in case
of vacancy, a successor to fill the seat of Shiogoon.</p>

<p>The San kio (three princes of the blood) were sons of the
eighth and ninth Shiogoons, and having in view the possible
extinction of the direct line of Iyeyas at the time, these
young men and their families seem to have been set apart,
in imitation of the Sin we, or imperial families at Miako.
They were assigned residences within the palace <i>enceinte</i> at
Yedo, but take no regular part in public business. They are
paid a yearly income by the Shiogoon, each having a separate
little court. The three princes are respectively called
Ta yass, Stotsbashi, and Say midzu. The last, the house
of Say midzu, is, so to speak, at present extinct and the
residence unoccupied, and though it is in the power of the
Shiogoon to reappoint a member of his family, it is not
likely soon to be filled up. The Go San kio are not styled
Daimios.</p>

<p>The Go tai ro, or Regent.—In a hereditary jurisdiction,
such as that of the Shiogoon, provision must be made for the
contingency of the youth or incapacity of the heir upon his
succession. Under this name, which means the great or
illustrious elder, a regency—an office similar to that of the
Sessio at Miako—is provided. It is an office which is only
filled when necessity calls for such an appointment; and
there are only certain men eligible for the office. He must
be a Fudai Daimio, and, if possible, one of the four known
as the Si Ten wo. These are Eeyee or Ee, Sakakibarra,
Sakkai, and Honda. Of these the first, Ee Kamong no kami,
is called the Do dai, or foundation-stone of the power of the
dynasty; the ancestor of the family, Ee nawo massa, having
been lieutenant-general and right-hand man to Iyeyas.</p>

<p>So long as things go smoothly, and the wheels of government
revolve, such rules may be carried out; but when any
country begins to ferment, the ablest or the least scrupulous
man comes to the surface. Previous to the accession of the
thirteenth Shiogoon, Iyay sada, Ee had gradually crept into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
a position of power (to which he may have been more or less
entitled) through the mental infirmity of the reigning Shiogoon.
He assumed or was voted into the office of regent.
Intrigues were rife in Yedo and Miako, and in consequence
of his leaning toward foreigners, or for other reasons, he
was assassinated.</p>

<p>It seems to have been the custom that the Fudai and
Kamong Daimios settled who was to be regent without
any reference to the Emperor; but since the opening up of
the country the Emperor has risen in importance, and at
present he or his officers settle who is to be the highest
officer when necessary. A common or vulgar name for the
Gotairo is Koken, or Oshiru me—<i>i.e.</i>, looker back or behind.
They have seldom held office long, and have too often come
to an untimely end.</p>

<p>The Go ro chiu, or Toshi yori (the senior central officers,
or the “Cabinet,” as they may be called), consists generally
of four or five Fudai Daimios appointed to the office by the
Shiogoon. All Fudai aspire to the office, but the members
are in quiet times chosen from the thirteen families mentioned
in the laws of Iyeyas as head Fudai. Among the
members of the Cabinet one is generally looked upon as
Prime Minister; but they all take duty in monthly rotation.
It is considered a great honor to have been ten years in office,
and the Shiogoon in such a case raises the territorial income
of such officer. This is the most responsible office, and too
often in times past has entailed upon its possessor the mistaken
duty of retrieving an error by the cowardly retreat of
suicide. They are responsible for the whole acts of government,
which are supposed either to have originated with
them or to have been carried out with their cognizance.
The Go ro chiu meets daily at 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> in the Go yo shta be
ya, a room in the palace. They preside in the Hio jo sho, or
deliberative assembly of acting officers, when the Shiogoon
is not present. But it is natural to suppose that when great
international questions come before the country, as the opening
up of trade with foreigners, the larger Daimios and Koku<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
shiu should have a voice, and should take a share in changes
of such magnitude. Consequently of late the Go ro chiu has
been rather set aside as things move toward Miako, where
before long the power and responsibility will fall to the corresponding
office at the imperial court.</p>

<p>The Japanese have a saying, that a wealthy man should
have little power in the state, but that comparatively poor
men should have the power. This seems to be one of their
principles of government.</p>

<p>Soba yo min is an office which is only occasionally filled,
as when the Shiogoon is young. He seems to be an officer
of communication between the Go ro chiu and the other departments.
This is the highest office filled by Hattamoto.</p>

<p>Waka toshi yori—literally, the younger elders or senators.
They are generally five in number, a second Cabinet,
or Under-Secretaries of State. They are Fudai Daimios, or
Hattamoto. They are frequently promoted to vacancies in
the Go ro chiu.</p>

<p>Sosha are generally Fudai, in number about thirty.
Their duty seems to be attending to officers arriving at
the palace. It is an office of little power and considerable
expense. They rise in ordinary times to be Jee sha, temple
lords, and other officers of authority.</p>

<p>The Kokay, or Kowokay, can hardly be called officers of
state. The name means high families (Ch., Kau kia), and
includes the male representative lines of some of the families
of distinction in ancient times, such as Nobu nanga, Ashikango,
Yoritomo, Arima, etc. It seems a matter of policy
to keep them under the eye of the court, giving each an
allowance from the state of territory from 500 to 1,000 koku
per annum. They are looked upon as men of high rank but
little power, being neither Daimios nor Koongays, but between
the two. They are occasionally employed to act as
proxies for the Shiogoon in state visits to the temples of
Nikko or Isse, and have attempted of late to assert their
right to act as embassadors to foreign countries. There are
about eighteen Kowokay at present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>O Tsu may shiu are Fudai Daimios who act as guards to
the apartments of the Shiogoon. From the room in which
they meet in the palace they are spoken of as Gan no ma
Daimios.—The room being painted with representations of
wild geese.</p>

<p>Jee sha (Ch., Sz shie) boonio, temple governors. These
are described by Kæmpfer as “imperial commissioners, inspectors,
protectors and judges of all the temples and the
monks belonging thereunto. This employment is, after the
Emperor’s Council of State (<i>i.e.</i>, the Go ro chiu), one of
the best in the empire, and the persons invested with it are
very much considered at court. They hold their court at
Yedo. All civil affairs relating to the clergy—such as lawsuits,
disputes arising about the limits or revenues of their
lands, prosecutions for wrongs or damages received, and
the like—are brought daily in great number to be decided
in this court. Again, all criminal cases—as rebellion, disregard
of the imperial proclamations and commands, and
in general all capital crimes committed by the ecclesiastics—are
tried before them, and, in case of conviction, punished
with death, though these criminals are much more indulged
than other people and cannot be executed without the consent
of and a warrant signed by the general at Miako. Another
branch of the business of these Dsisia Bugjo is to take care
of the maintenance of the clergy, to keep the temples in repair,
and otherwise, in all cases where the secular power
and authority is wanted, to assist them.”</p>

<p>Every Japanese is registered (or is supposed to be registered)
in some temple, and whenever he removes his residence,
the Nanushi, or head man of the temple, gives a certificate.
The books of each temple are sent to Yedo, to the
office of the Jee sha, where they are copied. These officers
act as judges in disputes between priests of one temple with
those of another; between Daimios in disputes about boundaries;
between Samurai and Hattamoto, but not between
merchants or farmers. The prison under their charge is
better kept and under milder restrictions than other prisons.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
They have under them numerous Do sin, or runners
of a higher class, to seize criminals. As they have to keep
up the prisons under their charge, the office is looked upon
as one of expenditure and not of profit. The numerous interests
with graduated degrees of ruling power in Japan
render great tact necessary in disputes between these interests.
The monasteries and priesthood are still very powerful,
the Daimios become jealous of interference, and the
interests of those holding of the Shiogoon, as well as of
those holding land of the Emperor in the Go ki nai, must
be considered; so that it is absolutely necessary, not only
that distinct laws should be laid down, but also that it
should be established who are to be the judges between
rival claimants.</p>

<p>One temple lord sits on the bench in the Hio jo sho every
month in rotation, and he is thence spoken of as Tski ban.</p>

<p>O Russui are Hattamoto officers, but rank as Daimios,
who have charge of the apartments of the Shiogoon, and
of the women of the palace when he is absent. They are
all old men. All young persons entering or leaving the
private quarter of the palace are examined as to sex. In
the office there is a female examiner. These officers give
passes to females on visits of business or ceremony. There
are generally eight officers, who have each under them ten
Yoriki and fifty Do sin. The income of each is 15,000 koku.</p>

<p>Owo ban kashira.—These are the captains of the great
guards of the castle of Yedo. There are twelve, seven Daimios
and five Hattamoto. Their duties are entirely military.
Under these twelve are one hundred Owo ban, who are all
Hattamoto.</p>

<p>Sho eeng ban kashira is also a military office, apparently
the bodyguard of the Shiogoon. There are ten commanding
officers.</p>

<p>Okosho ban kashira.—These seem to be lords-in-waiting
upon the Shiogoon, of whom there are ten. They are Hattamoto,
each having thirty men under him.</p>

<p>Owo metsuki—literally, great or senior attached eye.—Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
these there are five head men. Beneath these are the
Metsuki, and an inferior body of men called Katchi metsuki.</p>

<p>This is a very important department of the government
of Japan. The title is frequently translated “spy,” and the
duties seem in some cases to corroborate this view. But the
idea of espionage by no means conveys an accurate understanding
of the subjects under the care or control of these
officers.</p>

<p>One of the principal objects of the superintendence of this
department is the eight roads of Japan, and the regulations
of the laws of these roads. Another is the manners and customs
of officers in reference to state dress, their intended
marriages, going and coming to Yedo, and visiting elsewhere;
death and mourning of officers; receiving reports
sent in by the branches of the office in the provinces as to
the military equipment of Daimios, the uniforms, devices,
flags, which they use; in regard to religion, and especially
the Roman Catholic; as to the Yakunins, or inferior officers
of the Shiogoon’s government, their number and duties, and
the census of Japan. Such are some of the different kinds
of business which come before this office.</p>

<p>The laws of the roads are regulated in a separate branch
of the office, under the Do chiu boonio. The book of laws
or orders is the Do chiu boonio kokoroee, and, in its present
form, seems to have been published about 1840.</p>

<p>There were formerly five highways, afterward two were
added, and by the addition of the road to the temple of
Nikko, there are now eight. The office issues rules for
Daimios and Hattamoto passing along these roads, and for
merchants and farmers when traveling. In every village or
town along the road these rules are affixed in the To iya
or government office, for all the villages upon these highroads
are to a certain extent under the control of the government,
even when the road passes through the territories of
Daimios. The following are headings of these regulations:</p>

The strictness and minute care with which the Japanese
government watches over its people is shown in the regulations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
laid down for public women, known as Joro. This
name is only applied to those who are kept in government
establishments in the larger towns, as Yedo, Osaka, Miako,
Nagasaki, where a place in the town is set apart for their
residence. The laws for the regulation of morals are very
different in different parts of the empire. In the territories
of some Daimios, as Tosa and Kanga, public prostitutes
are not permitted, indecent songs are interdicted, and the
inns and bathing-houses regulated; but the government of
the Shiogoon considers these things to be necessary evils,
and takes them under its own charge. The finest women in
Japan are said to be in Etsizen and Idzumo, where they
are famed for the fineness of their complexions and smoothness
of skin, with higher noses and little or no smallpox.
It is said that men cannot leave Neegata, where the public
women are called Hak piak ya gokay, or 808 widows. This
name arose after one of the desolating battles in old times,
in which that number of husbands was slain and the widows
obliged to seek for wherewithal to live. In one night in 1860
the officers in Yokohama seized 108 young women who were
suspected of leading immoral lives without a license from
government. The most beautiful public women of Yedo
annually take a prominent part in the processions, or matsuri,
and their portraits are sold and hung up about the
large temples and places of resort.</p>

<p>Some officers travel free on the road, and their expenses
become a tax upon the people living in villages along the
road, and who are supposed to benefit by the travelers. Of
such are Daimios coming to pay respects to a new Shiogoon
upon his accession. In 1861 the Ooyay no mia, or High-priest
of Yedo, traveled with 250 followers. He was about
nineteen years of age. The walls of the inns at which he
stopped were newly papered, and new clean mats put on the
floors. For this the villages paid, he paying one boo—<i>i.e.</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
1s. 6d.; and on leaving, his servants tore the paper off and
cut the mats, that they might not be used again.</p>

<p>As to the Shoshidai, or envoy of the Shiogoon, when
traveling.</p>

<p>As to the governors of the castles of Osaka, Soonpu, or
Miako, or the guards of these castles. Governors of places
held of the Shiogoon, but at great distances from Yedo, as
Nagasaki and Hakodadi.</p>

<p>As to Koongays and such high officers when traveling.</p>

<p>As to Ray kayshi, or messengers sent annually to Nikko
by the Emperor.</p>

<p>As to carriage of ingredients for making gunpowder.</p>

<p>The Daikwangs, who look after the government farms
and woods. All of their men and goods are carried along
the public roads at the expense of the villages.</p>

<p>By this office the ceremonial due to high officers upon the
road is arranged.</p>

<p>If a Daimio in his norimono meet a high Koongay—one
of the Sekkay or Monzekke—his porters must not walk on,
but must stop till the high officer has passed, but he need not
get out.</p>

<p>The same respect is to be paid to the otchatsubo, or jars
containing the tea for the use of the Shiogoon.</p>

<p>A Byshing—<i>i.e.</i>, one of the higher retinue of a Daimio—must
leave his norimono and kneel down, taking off
his hat.</p>

<p>The same respect is to be shown by these Daimios and
Byshings to anything bearing the red seal of the Shiogoon,
to the great guards bringing up muskets, to the governors
of the castles at Miako, Soonpu, and Osaka, and to the
Shoshidai.</p>

<p>When a Daimio meets the Tenso, his norimono is to be
carried slowly, and on one side of the road.</p>

<p>A Byshing must kneel and take off his hat.</p>

<p>Porters can be obtained from 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to 8 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, but not at
any later hour.</p>

<p>Koongay and Monzekke are to be provided at the public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
expense with 35 horses and 50 porters. If they require more,
they must defray the expense themselves.</p>

<p>The “three families,” and higher Daimios and Emperor’s
messengers, are allowed 100 horses and 100 porters; lower
Daimios, 50 horses and men. Some Daimios are not allowed
to travel on the tokaido.</p>

<p>It is enjoined that members of the Gorochiu, the envoy
and governors of Osaka castle, when they meet a Daimio
upon the highway, ought to speak to him; but if they do
not wish to speak, they may say that they are not well.</p>

<p>If they meet in the same hotel at night, the Daimio is to
ask them if the Shiogoon requires his assistance in any way.</p>

<p>When they meet on the road, the Daimio must open the
door of his norimono and act as if he were going to get out,
but the other must request him not to do so.</p>

<p>Otchatsubo, or jars containing tea for the use of the
Shiogoon, are treated with great respect. If a captain of
a guard meets these jars carried by porters, he makes his
bearers go to one side, and his followers kneel and take off
their hats. The porters call out as they go along the roads,
and all the common people kneel down. This custom was
begun by Iyeyas. Recently there have been slights and insults
offered to these jars, to show personal feeling on the
part of some of those opposed to the present state of things,
as Satsuma.</p>

<p>Byshing entitled to carry a spear, upon meeting a member
of the Gorochiu, or the Shoshidai, or tea-jars, etc., must
wait till such dignitary is past. Byshing not entitled to a
spear are under the same customs as common people.</p>

<p>Two-sworded men singly meeting the tea-jars, Gorochiu,
etc., stop and take off the hat only, but do not kneel down.</p>

<p>All common people must kneel down and take off their
hats to Koongays, Shoshidai, Gorochiu, Oban kashira; and,
though there be no law for it, a Daimio often takes it into
his own hands and punishes or kills a man or woman who
does not kneel down while he is passing. Such was the case
with Shimadzu Saburo and Mr. Richardson in 1862; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
Shimadzu was not even a Daimio, but the father of the
young Daimio. On one occasion a Byshing of Kiogoku,
Nagato no kami, killed a man of Matzdaira, Sanuki no kami,
for turning aside upon the road and making water while
his norimono was passing; while another ordered a woman
to be cut down for standing and looking at him.</p>

<p>A Daimio with an income of 200,000 koku, with 20 horsemen
and 120 footmen in his retinue, is allowed 300 porters.
One of 100,000 koku, with 10 horsemen and 80 footmen, is
allowed 150 porters. One with 50,000 koku, with 7 horsemen
and 60 footmen, is allowed 100 porters; and so downward
in proportion.</p>

<p>When a Daimio meets a Gomiodai, or envoy from the
Shiogoon, he is to give him half the road, and to stop his
norimono while the envoy is passing.</p>

<p>The same respect is to be shown to envoys from the
Emperor (Chokoo shi), the royal family, the Tenso, and
other high officers.</p>

<p>In the case where one Daimio has taken possession of
an inn on the road, and another comes from an opposite
direction and wishes accommodation, this is sometimes the
cause of serious fighting.</p>

<p>If a Byshing be in the retinue of his superior lord, and a
government official with the red seal be met, he must not
get out of his norimono or off his horse; but if alone, he
must do so.</p>

<p>If a Daimio meet an imperial envoy (Chokoo shi) or
Eenshi, or a member of the royal family, a relative of the
Emperor, or a high Koongay, he may, if he wishes, turn off
the road up a by-road till the great man shall have passed,
to save himself from getting out of his norimono and kneeling
down, or, if he be riding on horseback, from dismounting.</p>

<p>To lower Koongays the Daimio must give half the road.</p>

<p>If a Byshing or Hattamoto is on government business
with the red seal, he is to be treated as a Daimio.</p>

<p>To one of the “three families” a Daimio is to get out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
his norimono and propose to kneel, but is to be requested
not to do so. As a general rule, to men of the third rank
and above, Daimios must kneel; to men of the fourth
rank and below, no ceremonial is required.</p>

<p>These headings may give some idea of what the duties of
the road department of the Owo metski office are.</p>

<p>It is further the duty of the office to see that the roads
and bridges are kept in repair.</p>

<p>From these rules it is evident that great exactness must
be insisted upon in traveling along the highroads as to the
days when officers are to leave each place, and the houses
at which they are to stop, in order that there may be no
confusion in official arrangements, and to avoid unpleasant
collisions which might happen on the road. The office must
even at times take into consideration the private feelings of
individuals. At one time the young Eeyee Kamong no
kami was coming up to Yedo with a large retinue, and
Shimadzu Saburo of Satsuma was going down to Miako.
In two days they were to meet on the tokaido, when the
whole country expected to see a fight, for which both parties
were prepared. But the office, hearing of it, sent peremptory
orders to Eeyee to go round by another road.</p>

<p>The Owo metski office must be consulted previous to the
betrothal or marriage of a Daimio or his eldest son, and also
previous to the adoption of a son by a Daimio. Marriages
and adoptions are generally made in their own class, and
frequently among relatives; but some of the Daimios are
married to the daughters of the highest Koongays.</p>

<p>The members of this office appear to act as reporters in
all government meetings. Indeed, whenever two or three
persons meet together in Japan, there seems to be some
member of this silently observant office present. Reports of
everything that goes on throughout the empire are sent into
this office for the information of government, and these
reports are recorded for reference. Men acting nominally
as horseboys and servants in the foreign consulates have
been emissaries from this department.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>By law every innkeeper is obliged to keep a book (Yado
cho), in which every traveler is noted down, and what he
may do or say that may be thought worth reporting. Similar
books (Gio koo cho) are kept in public brothels, in which
are noted the names of men frequenting them (if the names
can be got), or marks upon their bodies; how much money
they spend, the saki they drink, etc. These are all for the
use of this office.</p>

<p>The prevention of the spread of the Roman Catholic or
Jashiu mong sect is one of the cares of the Dai Kwang department
of the Owo metski office. The names, with the genealogy,
of all the families among which there were known
to be Roman Catholic converts are carefully kept. Boards,
called Christang hatto kaki, on which are printed a prohibition
of the Christian religion, are put up in every large temple.
Individuals belonging to the families under observation
are not allowed to move their place of residence without permission
of this office. If one dies, intimation must be given
to the office, when an officer is sent to view the body, and all
the relatives sign a certificate. Or if at a distance, it must
be preserved in salt. The Dai Kwang office superintended
the Yay boomi, or trampling on the cross, once a year at
Nagasaki. It is the duty of the office to examine for Christians
all over the western provinces once in three years.
Whenever a child is born in a family formerly Christian,
notice must be given to the office. Marriages must be reported;
and also the intended adoption of a son. Adopted
sons are sometimes thrown back again by the adopting parents,
but Christians are not allowed to do this. A register
for the same purpose is kept by the governor of Miako.
These forms are kept up to the great-grandchildren of the
original Roman Catholics, but have of late fallen into desuetude;
but it may hereafter prove the means of stirring up
dying embers of faith among the descendants in the recollections
of their ancestors. The members of this department,
while sitting with others, report, but have neither a
voice nor a vote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>Matchi boonio.—The street governors, or, as they may
be called, governors or mayors of Yedo. (The Shiogoon
himself is considered governor of Yedo, and Mito is hereditary
Fuko Shiogoon or Vice-Shiogoon, and ought as such to
reside constantly in Yedo.) Of these there are two; the one
over the east, the other over the west part. The authority
of these officers is chiefly over the mercantile class. They
have little or no power over the Samurai, or two-sworded
gentry. Their duties are with the streets and police of Yedo.
They sit as judges alternately, and take cognizance of all
questions and quarrels among the mercantile class. Upon a
Daimio coming to stay at Yedo each alternate year, he is to
call on and pay his respects to the Gorochiu, Wakatoshiyori,
Owo metski, and Matchi boonio, before he goes to his own
house.</p>

<p>Go Kanjo boonio may be called the head of the exchequer.
These are two officers who keep the accounts of the empire;
they also act as judges in all cases between persons of the
agricultural class. They have great power. Of the Do chiu
boonio, or governors of the roads, one is always Kanjo
boonio, and one is Owo metski. The mint and coinage of
money come under this department. Under them they have
five men as seconds or assistants, Kanjo gim maku, besides
two men who upon alternate days keep the accounts of the
expenses in the Shiogoon’s palace.</p>

<p>Sakushi boonio are two Hattamoto officers, superintendents
of the carpenters of the Shiogoon, and under them are
four men, Daiko kashira. As mentioned before, the trade
of a carpenter is looked upon in Japan as a very honorable
occupation.</p>

<p>Besides these, there are Shta boonio and Fusim boonio,
who superintend the carpenters of the offices and women’s
apartments, the wells in the castle, providing tables, boxes,
mats, etc.</p>

<p>Goong Kan.—The naval department has two governors—Goong
Kan boonio. These may be called Lords of the
Admiralty, but until recently the office was one of comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
minor consideration. There were four naval instructors
under these governors who had picked up some
little knowledge from the Dutch and from Dutch works on
naval affairs. Latterly, the office has become one of much
greater importance. Great attention is being paid to naval
matters and to steam, and the office has consequently been
remodeled. The government has invested largely in steam-vessels,
and has erected steam works for making and repairing
all sorts of machinery, and is making every attempt to
obtain a well-educated set of men, who shall be thoroughly
instructed in all the branches requisite for naval officers.
At Nagasaki the Japanese government has one large set of
works, and another in the vicinity of Yedo. A dry-dock has
been excavated for the cleaning and repair of the vessels of
government. Until lately the Japanese government seems
to have paid no attention to keeping any vessels of war.
Fast-rowing boats were kept near Nagasaki, and one at
Uraga, in the bay of Yedo, and at other stations ordinary
boats were kept. These, however, were generally noted
for speed rather than strength, and rarely put to sea, but
watched vessels coming to land and overhauled them on
the part of the custom house.</p>

<p>Ko bo shin shi hai.—This seems to be an office for young
unemployed Hattamoto officers, where records are kept of
what each excels in, for the information of government.</p>

<p>Shin ban kashira.—School for teaching young officers
about the court riding, rifle-shooting, etc.</p>

<p>Okosho is a general name for officers waiting on the
person of the Shiogoon.</p>

<p>Naka oku go ban shiu.—Some of the private guards of
the Shiogoon.</p>

<p>Hoko nando.—Men who look after the dresses and clothes
of the Shiogoon; and others are in the flag office or the spear
office.</p>

<p>Hiaku nin Kumi no kashira.—These are guards. They
were originally Yamabooshi priests, called Negoro and Nengoro,
or, as the translator of the letters writes it, Negroes, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
the large monastery of Kumano, in the province of Kii; and
after their buildings were burned down by Taikosama, and
their lands confiscated, they joined the army in a body,
and Iyeyas attached them to himself as guards.</p>

<p>There are departments for superintending the manufacture
of bows and arrows, and muskets, rifles and cannon.</p>

<p>Another office has the charge of balls, shells, powder,
etc.; and another has the charge of the armory, containing
bows and arrows, rifles and coats of mail.</p>

<p>Hon maro russui ban.—The Hon maro is the name of
that part of the castle or shiro of Yedo occupied by the Shiogoon.
Six officers keep it when he leaves it temporarily.</p>

<p>Ni no maro russui ban.—Keepers of the part assigned to
the son or concubines of the Shiogoon.</p>

<p>Hikeshi.—These are fire brigades in the service of the
Shiogoon in Yedo, of which there are twelve, one to a district;
each under the charge of a Daimio.</p>

<p>These guard against fires in the castle, the government
godowns in the town, and the large temples where the tombs
of the Shiogoons are. Each brigade has a leader, who holds
on the end of a long pole a mattoyay, or white solid device,
easily seen at night. The duty of this leader seems to be to
stand as near the fire, and as long as he possibly can; and in
fulfilling this duty they appear to rival the fabulous salamander.
Each brigade has overcoats with distinguishing
marks, and masks the better to stand the heat. However,
in wooden buildings their organization seems of little use.
The fires generally wear out of themselves, the inhabitants
carrying off their money, clothes, mats and windows to
places of safety. There are other fire-engines and fire brigades
in Yedo under the Matchi boonio. The town is divided
into forty-eight districts, corresponding to the letters of the
alphabet I, Ro, Ha, and to each district there is a brigade.
If a fire breaks out in the Ro district, all the men of the Ro
brigade go to it. The rest of the town unburned pays each
man of the brigade employed four tempos, or about 6d., after
the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>Daimios keep men of their own as firemen, generally men
in some small disgrace, whose names have been erased from
the town books or dismissed from employment.</p>

<p>At one time fires occurred so frequently in Yedo that a
notification was issued that the proprietor of the first house
in which a fire should thereafter originate should be transported
to the islands. The first offender was Mito. It would
not do to transport him, so he fell upon the plan of borrowing,
through the priesthood, on payment of a large sum,
30,000 days from eternity, beyond which time he had little
prospect of living. This has frequently since been found
to be an ingenious plan for men of wealth escaping
punishments.</p>

<p>Metski are lower officers of the Owo metski department,
and seem to act as judges in civil cases. There are fourteen
Metski.</p>

<p>Tskybang are messengers, attendants in war or during
fires to the Shiogoon.</p>

<p>Taka jo.—Keepers of the Shiogoon’s hawks.</p>

<p>Katchi ngashira.—The officer who superintends the men
lining the streets when the Shiogoon goes out—a ceremony,
however, which has been done away with.</p>

<p>Jiu ri si ho—meaning “ten miles in four directions.”—Men
whose duty it is to take care that no one shoots within
ten ri—<i>i.e.</i>, twenty-five miles—of the castle. Even within
this distance there are places in which native sportsmen are
allowed to shoot, for which permission is given upon application.
An infraction of this law was the reason given for
the seizure of an Englishman in 1859—one of the <i>causes
célèbres</i> in the early history of Great Britain’s relations
with Japan. This is a sub-branch of the Owo metski office.</p>

<p>Shiu mong aratame is the branch of the same office which
examines into the religion of individuals, especially with the
object of restraining the spread of Christianity.</p>

<p>Do chiu boonio is the officer who has charge of the highroads,
bridges, etc., under the Owo metski.</p>

<p>To zoku (Tau tsih—catch thief) Hi tske is the same as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
Kai yaku—<i>i.e.</i>, reforming officers. This is, in its subordinate
offices, a very wide department—aiming at thorough
espionage, secrecy in detection, and surveillance, as well as
overpowering strength in carrying out the wishes of government.
The whole of society in Japan is permeated by officers
of this department. All public places are full of them.
Inns are kept by them; they reside as priests in temples, or
wherever the general public resorts. The keepers of these
inns and farmers in the country are frequently in the employ
of the police. There is a saying in Japan, “Dorobo oi zen”—implying
that it is better to put money on a thief’s back
than to apply to the police. The police runners have means
at the stations for constantly strengthening themselves by
gymnastic exercises, and are taught to tie up criminals in a
variety of ways, from so lightly as to lie like a net, to so
tightly that before long the victim is strangled. They are
always provided with a short iron baton, with which, in
case of resistance, they strike their man over the head to
stun him.</p>

<p>Ko boo shio boonio.—The military school where drill exercise,
the use of weapons of war, fortification and military
tactics generally, are taught to young officers. There are
three officers over the establishment, but many teachers of
the different branches. The school is in Owo ngawa matchi
or street in Yedo. Artillery is taught near the garden of
the Shiogoon at Hama go teng. Sword-practice with sticks
(kenjits) is a favorite amusement with young officers. They
have sticks with basket guards, with which they practice.
Before beginning, each puts on an iron wire grating over
the head, a bamboo-and-leather belt around the chest, and
bamboo guards for the arms with gloves. Yet with all this
one is sometimes severely handled. The sword is long, two-handed,
sharp on one edge and at the point, and for about
two inches from the point on the back; so that they either
cut or thrust, and aim at cutting the neck with a back cut.
They are very dexterous at the use of this weapon, whether
against a sword or a bayonet or spear. Practice with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
rifle is also very common in the government schools, and in
the grounds of Daimios about Yedo. There is a large parade
ground or open country to the back of Yedo for the use
of the military, called Hiro.</p>

<p>Naka kawa bansho.—An office for the examination of
boats coming from and passing to the interior by the communicating
branch of the river—the Naka gawa. Upon this
stream boats can go to the provinces on the northwest, north
and east of Yedo. Besides these there are officers who have
charge of the Shiogoon’s barges and boats.</p>

<p>There are officials whose duty is to examine into alleged
encroachments by Daimios in Yedo upon the roads, streets,
rivers, or sea. The superficial quantity of land as gardens
that an officer may hold in Yedo is regulated by his official
income. (One tsubo equals thirty-six square feet.) An income
of from 300 to 900 koku may have 500 tsubo, 18,000
square feet; 1,000 to 1,900 koku may have 700 tsubo, 25,200
square feet; 2,900 koku may have 1,000 tsubo, 36,000 square
feet; 4,000 koku may have 1,500 tsubo, 54,000 square feet.
And so on up to 150,000, whose allotment is 7,000 tsubo, or
about 252,000 feet square.</p>

<p>There are sword-keepers of the Shiogoon, and also keepers
of the books or library, and a keeper of the presents,
gifts, or tribute paid by each Daimio. Gifts as tribute are
being received daily, and are regulated by order. But frequently
handsome presents are voluntarily made by Daimios,
perhaps in some cases for favors to come. For instance,
Owarri is ordered to present to the Shiogoon upon the first
month, third day, congratulatory cakes.</p>

<p>Upon the third and seventh months a large noshi—symbol
of a present with a piece of dried fish—with paper and
two tubs of wine.</p>

<p>On the 18th of the fourth month, fish; and again in
the same month, A-ï, a fresh-water fish, considered a delicacy.</p>

<p>On the fourth and eighth months, the same fish preserved
in vinegar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>On the sixth month, the first day, ice. It is a custom in
Japan to use ice upon that day.</p>

<p>On the sixth and seventh months, muskmelon.</p>

<p>In hot weather, in summer, anything he thinks may
please.</p>

<p>On the sixth day of the ninth month, one obang (a large
gold coin, worth above £6) or more.</p>

<p>During the ninth and tenth months, persimmons—the
best come from Mino.</p>

<p>During the eleventh month, tea, cakes, fish, saki and
Owarri radishes, which are very large and fine.</p>

<p>During the twelfth month, fish, persimmons, storks,
which are supposed to be a royal bird, and only for the
table of the Shiogoon; but many people eat them.</p>

<p>A present from an inferior to a superior, as from a Daimio
to the Shiogoon, is “Kenjio”; the reverse is “Hyrio.”
The Shiogoon is said to have called in proclamation the
steamer “Emperor,” presented to him by her majesty the
Queen of England, “Kenjio.”</p>

<p>The Shiogoon has also four secretaries for private business,
and others for government business.</p>

<p>There are professors or teachers of the works and writings
of Confucius. There is a school or college for the
study of foreign books; but the school was lately entirely
remodeled, and greater encouragement given to the study
of foreign languages, books, and arts and sciences.</p>

<p>There is an observatory, with astronomers, compilers of
the almanac, etc.</p>

<p>Nineteen physicians attend upon the Shiogoon, five of
whom practice after the European system, and fourteen
after the Chinese. There are five surgeons, of whom one
practices according to the European system, and medical
officers for treatment by acupuncture—<i>i.e.</i>, by insertion of
fine needles. These are fine flexible wires, not so strong as
those used in imitation of them in Europe, but requiring a
tube to be used for their insertion to prevent the needles
bending. There are also dentists and oculists and medical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
men for attending officers on duty at the castle, and others
for attending officers who are outside the castle. There is
one medical man for vaccination, together with consulting
physicians; and also doctors to look after the sick poor and
destitute. There is or was a public hospital at Koishikawa.</p>

<p>There is an officer who may be called poet-laureate.</p>

<p>There are musicians to the court, and teachers of the
Sinto religion; also teachers of a game, a kind of chess, as
well as chess itself.</p>

<p>After these are the keepers of the wicket-gate by which
females go out or come in, and men to look out from a lofty
platform. Such are always raised in Diamio’s houses, to
enable the watchmen to look down upon the surrounding
streets by day, and to look out for fires by night.</p>

<p>There are keepers of the jewels belonging to the Shiogoon.</p>

<p>There is one officer who looks after the food for the Shiogoon,
and keeps the accounts of the expenditure of the table,
as well as inspectors of rice for the use of the Shiogoon
himself.</p>

<p>The head-cook superintends the kitchen, and there are
also cooks for guests.</p>

<p>Hama goteng boonio.—The governor of the Hama goteng,
a garden on the seaside beneath the castle in Yedo. This is
a large piece of ground cut off by a canal, and formerly kept
as a private garden for the recreation of the Shiogoon on the
seaside. It is one of the places offered to the foreign ministers
for residences in Yedo, and refused by them upon, possibly,
good grounds. It has since that time been converted
into a ground for artillery practice. There were three head
gardeners.</p>

<p>There are men to look after the garden for medicinal
herbs, and officers who have charge of the curtains used for
concealment or privacy. These “macu” have been sometimes
thought by foreigners to be intended to represent forts;
but they are constantly used in Japan by pleasure parties
and others wishing to be in the open air, and yet to enjoy
a little privacy; and it is considered rude to look over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
edge of one at the party inclosed. They may be used also
in war to conceal the numbers of a host. The “mong,” or
crest of the owner, is generally stamped upon the curtain,
which has at a distance, perhaps, given the idea of loopholes.</p>

<p>Kane boonio.—Four officers who pay out and receive
payments on account of the Shiogoon. Payments are made
on the 6th, 14th and 26th days of the month. Money is
received on the 1st, 10th, 18th and 24th.</p>

<p>There is an office for the exchange of notes or orders for
officers. Banks and Daimios issue paper money, called
tayngata, and also gin sats (silver card), kin satz (golden
card). They are much used by the merchants in Osaka in
business transactions.</p>

<p>Koora boonio.—Officers in charge of the rice storehouses
belonging to government. These storehouses of rice are very
large, as a great part of the pay of officers is given in rice.
It is considered degrading to speak of paying money in salary.
Even presents of money among the lower classes are
always wrapped up in red paper neatly folded. A man is
hired as servant for so much rice, known as footchi—<i>i.e.</i>,
rice given on hire; footchi is always given in addition to
money, and it is proper to speak of footchi, not of money-hire.
In Taikosama’s time one footchi was 10 ngo of rice;
now it is only 5 ngo, or about 2 pounds. In speaking of
a man’s income, if pioh (or piculs) are mentioned, rice is
meant; but if koku, ground to the valued extent of production.
Retainers are paid 30 piculs a year, and half a
sho (1½ pounds of rice) per diem. In government payments
the rice is measured in boxes, not weighed. The
Chinese picul is equal to 133 pounds, but the Japanese was
generally larger, and ranged from about 150 to 160 pounds.
The koku, therefore, would be 450 to 500 pounds. According
to Williams, it contains 5.13 bushels.</p>

<p>There are officers in charge of the oil and lacquer, and
others over the working carpenters and masons. Others are
over the government forests and trees, for superintending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
planting, cutting, etc. Special officers have charge of the
Shiogoon’s pleasure barges on the river. A tax or license is
imposed upon all boats plying on the river at Yedo, collected
by another officer.</p>

<p>Tattame boonio.—Officer to look after the mats about the
palace. The whole floor of the rooms of the palace is exactly
covered by mats, each six feet long by three broad. These
mats are two inches in thickness, and are made of straw
tightly tied together by string. This is covered by a woven
web of fine, long, strong, dried grass from the sea-coast. In
the houses of all classes in Japan these mats are used, but in
those of the wealthier classes they are very beautifully made,
soft and pleasant to walk on for persons wearing stockings
only, as is the custom. The reception room in the palace
is called the Hall of a Thousand Mats. If there be such a
room it would be 150 feet long by 120 wide; but as the partition
walls in Japanese houses are, between many of the
apartments, only light sliding screens, movable at pleasure,
it may be easy to throw open a very large room in an extensive
building such as the palace is.</p>

<p>There is a jeweler to the court, and auditors of accounts,
who are also assayers or examiners of gold and silver.</p>

<p>There are teachers of riding to the Shiogoon, and veterinary
surgeons and horsebreakers.</p>

<p>Katchi me tski.—A low class of spies. These are kept
secretly by government, and are employed in nominal employments,
in houses, shops, or wherever information is
likely to be obtained. They are frequently grooms, as in
this capacity they accompany their masters wherever they
go. They write down whatever they hear or see that is suspicious:
the thin paper partitions of the rooms give facility
for this, as they have only to put the tongue against the
paper and then push the finger through, when a hole sufficiently
large is made, through which both to see and hear.
If these men allow themselves to be detected by Samurais,
or officers, no mercy is shown to them. If they have, as is
generally the case, a sort of written commission, and this is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
found upon them, they are put to death and the paper is sent
to the government. No notice is afterward taken of such a
deed. It is looked upon as a dangerous profession, and they
know the risk, but they are generally well paid. Daimios
use them also. Mito had a man in 1862 in the employ of
Ikeda, then governor of Yedo. He watched his master
intriguing against his lord, and assassinated him. An officer
was long in the employ of the British consulate at
Yokohama who was in constant communication with the
government.</p>

<p>There are officers, keepers of the stairs of the castle, and
others who look after the fires and fireplaces.</p>

<p>Bowozu are young men who act as servants to guests or
officers residing in the castle. It is not permitted to Daimios
to bring their servants into the palace. They are waited on
by the Bowozu. These men are said to be open to giving up
to any one copies of any or all documents passing through
the government offices on payment of a small sum—30 to
50 itzaboos per annum.</p>

<p>Officers are appointed for keeping the time by striking a
large drum, and there are men who give signals by blowing
a shell, such as is used generally for directing movements in
warlike operations.</p>

<p>Yoshiba boonio.—Yoshiba is the name of a penal establishment
on the island of Tsukudajima, at the mouth of the
Yedo River, to which certain criminals are sent, to prepare
oil and charcoal.</p>

<p>The above list comprises all the officers engaged in the
service of the Shiogoon, and who may be considered government
officials conducting the business of their departments in
offices in Yedo. But as the office of Shiogoon is in abeyance
it remains to be seen in what manner the government is to be
hereafter carried on; and whether the court of Miako, which
is now temporarily removed to Yedo, will return to the older
titles and offices as known at Miako, or will adopt the forms
and offices which have been in use at the court of the Shiogoon
in Yedo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>The Hio jo shio—The Board of Deliberation.—This is a
large place of meeting for deliberation in Yedo, outside of
the palace-moat, and close to the residences of the Gorochiu.
On fixed days of every month certain officers sit here for
the discharge of their duties. These seem to be to receive
complaints against officers, and to decide cases brought before
them for judgment. Upon other fixed days, all Daimios
or Hattamoto upon duty in Yedo seem to have the right, or
are called upon as a duty, to meet for the discussion of political
matters laid before them. Hio jo means to deliberate or
hold a consultation; and at these times the Gorochiu, Wakadoshi
yori, Owo me tski, and other officers, meet here for
deliberation upon affairs affecting the government.</p>

<p>Within the palace Daimios meet in rooms according to
their rank, and the class of Daimios is often spoken of by
the name of the room in the palace in which it meets—as
the Obee no ma, the Tomari no ma, the Yanangi no ma, the
Gan no ma, the Kiri no ma, the Tay kan no ma, the Fuyo
no ma, or the Goyobeya, or the Siro jo in (or Kuro jo in),
in which last all classes seem on occasions to meet. But it
is only in rare cases that all are called together; such an occasion
was the proposal brought before them by Commodore
Perry to overturn the old laws and throw open the country.
It has been seen that Iyeyas in his laws thought the meeting
of this assembly, the Hio jo sho, very important, and he said
that the president must be a man of the clearest intellect and
best disposition, and that once in every month it should be
the duty of the Shiogoon to go to the assembly without previous
intimation, and there act as judge.</p>

<p>Immediately in front of the building stands a box, known
as the Mayassu hako. Into this box any one may put a
paper of complaint upon any subject which he wishes to
bring before the assembly. These papers, “Mayassu,” are
taken out and examined, and those which are signed are discussed,
those which have no signature are burned. There
are similar boxes at Miako and Osaka.</p>

<p>The following may be taken as a sketch, or very imperfect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
translation, of the matters which come under the
cognizance of the assembly as instructions to officers:</p>

<p>1. When a complaint is made with reference to ground
in a street in front of, and generally belonging to, a temple,
and which is frequently let as shops, etc.; or in reference
to Go rio, ground belonging to the Shiogoon; or Shi rio,
ground belonging to Daimios—these complaints are not to
be taken up by the board, but are to be referred to the
Tskiban (the temple lord who is sitting for the month).</p>

<p>2. All quarrels and complaints between and against Yedo
street people, citizens of Yedo, are to be referred to the governor
of Yedo.</p>

<p>3. In the Kwang hasshiu, or eight provinces immediately
around Yedo—Awa, Kadsusa, Simosa, Hitatse, Simotsuki,
Kowotsuki, Segami and Musasi—disputes between the tenants
of the Shiogoon and those of Daimios or Dai kangs are
to be referred to the treasury governor. These three governors
are known as the “San boonio.”</p>

<p>4. Proceedings as to disputes between Daimios as to
ground.</p>

<p>5. Between brothers as to succession to the father’s
property.</p>

<p>6. In the case of a demand for a new trial after a decision
has been given.</p>

<p>7. In regard to petitions from friends to let a prisoner
out of confinement on the ground of his innocence, must
have good reasons shown.</p>

<p>8. If the people want an alteration or change of a law.</p>

<p>9. What is to be done with papers, Hakko so, put into
the box.</p>

<p>10. If people complain of officers.</p>

<p>11. In a complaint of an improper judgment in a case
(perhaps in another court).</p>

<p>12. Business in the Hio jo shio. The 2d, 11th and 21st
days of the month are “Siki jits,” or days when public political
business is discussed. The 4th, 13th and 25th, “Tatchi
yeibi,” the officers meet as judges to decide cases. On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
6th, 18th and 27th, “Uchi yori yeibi,” secret meeting days,
the officers meet to examine and discuss secret political matters
among themselves.</p>

<p>13. The form to be followed when a case has been for a
long time before the Hio jo shio and is referred to another
judge, as the street governor; and what is to be done in reference
to complaints against the Gorochiu, Wakatoshiyori,
or Owometski.</p>

<p>14. Complaints against Yakunins, or officers on duty outside
of Yedo, are to be referred to the Shiogoon.</p>

<p>15. Disputes as to water for irrigation, and embankments
of rice fields, which are sources of frequent quarrels, are to
be taken up by the Hio jo shio.</p>

<p>16. In disputes as to boundaries of property, the old titles
in the hands of the disputants are to be examined, and compared
with the “Midzu cho” (water book, or register), kept
in the Daikang office for the registration of boundaries and
property.</p>

<p>17. In disputes as to land, to apply to the proper office to
have surveys made.</p>

<p>18. What is to be done in cases of forgery of title-deeds
of lands, or of maps of villages, islands, etc., which is a
common offense.</p>

<p>19. As to disputes between Kanushi, heads of temples
and of government temples.</p>

<p>20. In cases where application is made by the friends of
a criminal to have him pardoned, such is not to be entertained
in cases of arson, theft, murder, either as principal or
accomplice, striker of father or mother or master, gamblers,
head men of villages convicted of extorting money, mikassa
(literally three hats),<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and men who have bought young
girls secretly. These crimes are not to be pardoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>21. As to arbitrations ordered by officers, only a certain
number of days to be allowed to make such arbitration—the
office to settle how many.</p>

<p>22. When a petition has been presented by one party and
the other does not appear, what is to be the proceeding.</p>

<p>23. Accusations of theft and fire-raising are not to be
brought before the Hio jo shio, but before the officer in
whose jurisdiction the offense is committed.</p>

<p>24. In cases of discovery of a long antecedently committed
murder.</p>

<p>25. If a man destroys a summons issued by the office,
and refuses to obey it.</p>

<p>26. Cases of persons trying to pass the barriers at Hakonay
and Arai, without the knowledge of the officers stationed
at the barriers.</p>

<p>27. In a case of firing a pistol or gun at another without
killing, the punishment is “chiu tsui ho”—<i>i.e.</i>, the culprit is
not allowed to enter a town or village. If a man wishes to
shoot or sport near Yedo, he must get a license from the
Yakunins to do so within the ten ri between Hatch ogee
and Kanagawa upon the Tama River. Native sportsmen
frequently shoot.</p>

<p>28. How persons are to be dealt with for snaring birds,
or <i>feræ naturæ</i>, on the hunting-lands of the Shiogoon.</p>

<p>29. In towns, if a man have committed a small offense,
the Yakunins may order his door to be shut upon him, and
him to be confined in his own house.</p>

<p>30. Cases of embezzlement of money by village head men.</p>

<p>31. Punishment for a man who has failed to enroll his
name in the official register.</p>

<p>32. If a man offer a bribe to an officer he is to be severely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
punished; the officer, if he accepts it, is lightly dealt
with.</p>

<p>33. All the property of a person, convicted of theft or
robbery is to be confiscated.</p>

<p>34. If the people on a Daimio’s territory send a remonstrance
against his oppression to the Hio jo shio, what is to
be done with it.</p>

<p>35. All the goods belonging to a debtor may be sold to
pay his debts, except his wearing apparel.</p>

<p>36. If persons try to bring wild ground into cultivation,
and call it their own without informing the officers, what
proceedings are to be taken.</p>

<p>37. Cases of litigation as to rented ground.</p>

<p>38. When persons are unable, from poverty, to pay government
taxes upon ground occupied by them.</p>

<p>39. In regard to loans of money, of which twenty different
kinds are alluded to—to a friend, to a temple, etc.</p>

<p>40. If the whole of a loan cannot be repaid, and it is
referred to the officers, they are to settle the interest to be
paid. Upon large amounts the interest is placed low, upon
small amounts it is high. Upon 10,000 kobangs the rate
will be 80 kobangs per month, or nearly 10 per cent per
annum. Upon one boo it may be one tenpo a month, or 75
per cent per annum.</p>

<p>41. In borrowing money, the interest is to vary with the
security. If the security is land, the interest is to be low;
with any other securities the interest should be high.</p>

<p>42. In disputes as to money: If no witnesses are brought
forward; if partners in business quarrel; if persons in theaters
quarrel; if a collector uses subscriptions to temples for
his own purposes; if the evidence depends upon a paper
without a date; if no rate of interest is mentioned—then
these cases are not to be taken up.</p>

<p>43. If it is alleged that a Daimio has borrowed money
from some town or body of people, and they do not bring
forward a receipt, such is to be dismissed.</p>

<p>44. If one creditor refuses to have a composition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>45. The officers may settle the time to be allowed to pay
off a debt, after which the securities may be taken. For
1,000 kobangs, 12 months to be allowed; for 30 kobangs, 40
days.</p>

<p>46. When property already mortgaged is given in security.</p>

<p>47. In cases where the cargo of a ship is secretly sold
upon her passage, and a story of bad weather is told.</p>

<p>48. When a father has sealed a draft of his intended will,
and has not written it out, what is the position of the heirs.</p>

<p>49. When false witnesses are suborned.</p>

<p>50. Houses or ground are sometimes sold by relatives
when the heir is young. It is therefore criminal to buy
ground without giving intimation to the proper officer.</p>

<p>51. It is the custom to have guarantees for servants, to
whom wages are generally paid in advance. If the servant
runs away with his wages, his surety must pay for him.</p>

<p>52. Half-yearly engagements with servants at the third
and ninth month are usual. If a servant runs away before
his time is out, his surety is responsible.</p>

<p>53. If it is another servant that is surety, he is responsible.</p>

<p>54. When a Daimio’s servant runs away, what is to be
done.</p>

<p>55. It is usual to have ten sureties—how this is to be
settled. Not more than ten to be allowed.</p>

<p>56. If a runaway servant steals from his master.</p>

<p>57. If a man stays away from his wife for ten months she
may marry again. When he returns he is to be punished.</p>

<p>58. If a poor man secretly marries and has a child, and
exposes it on the street, or if another man buys it and exposes
it, either shall be speared or beheaded. The head man
of the street is to be fined and deported from Yedo, and the
Gonin gumi or police guard of the street are to be punished.</p>

<p>The head man of a village or block of streets is Nanushi;
under him is Iyaynushi. The Go nin gumi are five police
in every street, who are appointed and paid by the streets.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
Nanushi often have much power and become wealthy.
Iyeyas in his laws tried to prevent this, as it is in too
many cases the result of oppression and bribery. In Yedo
and Osaka the government appoints the Nanushi; in Miako
the people appoint them. The Nanushi of a village is generally
a hereditary office.</p>

<p>59. If a man shall have adopted a daughter and then
sells her to the government stews (Yosiwara), he is to be
punished. The punishment is to vary according to the
wealth and the ability of the offender to support the child.</p>

<p>60. If any one secretly sells girls for prostitution to any
one but the Yosiwara, he is liable to punishment.</p>

<p>61. If a man sells his wife to the Yosiwara without reason,
he is to be beheaded. But if the wife agrees to be so
sold, and they are very poor, they may make such an arrangement.
It was formerly the custom to kill a wife if she
was unfaithful, but of late the custom has been to dispose of
her to the Yosiwara.</p>

<p>62. The crime of adultery is to be punished with death
(? in the case of the wife only).</p>

<p>63. Men and women who commit suicide together are
not to receive burial like men, but like dogs. If they attempt
and do not succeed, they are to be exposed on the
Nihon bas (bridge) for three days, and then made beggars.</p>

<p>64. If a bozan or priest commit adultery, he shall be
beheaded. In cases of fornication, if it be the head priest,
he shall be transported to the islands; if a young priest, he
shall be exposed on the Nihon bas for three days. (Some
years ago one hundred and seventy young priests were thus
exposed on the bridge at one time by Midzu no Idzumi no
kami.)</p>

<p>65. In cases of persons professing San cho ha (three birds)
Foosjiu (not take), Foossay (not give), they are to be transported.
What these may mean it is difficult to find out; but
possibly they are names for some form of religion, either

if one shall find any money or article of value and keep it.</p>

<p>108. In Yedo it is the custom to take out a drunken man,
or a man that has died on the street, and lay him in another.
This is to be punished.</p>

<p>109. If a man accused of a serious crime should die, his

<p>119. In reference to the children of a criminal, a difference
is made between the children of an officer and a common
person.</p>

<p>120. All villages have registers and plans of the ground
belonging to each, and to the families of the villagers. These
are sealed and kept by the head man of the village (nanushi),
and he is bound to let any one inspect the registers. If he
refuse, and complaint is made, he is to be punished.</p>

<p>121. What is to be done upon their liberation with criminals
who have been confined for slight offenses.</p>

<p>In case of disputes between persons belonging to the four
provinces round Miako, Yamashiro, Yamato, Tanba, and
Owomi, they are brought before the street governor of
Miako; but if a dispute arises between a person living in
one of these provinces and an outsider, the case is brought
to Yedo. Litigation arising in the provinces of Idzumi,
Kawatchi, Setsu, and Harima, is brought before the governor
of Osaka.</p>

<p>No taxes are paid in Miako.</p>

<p>If a murder or arson be committed within the territory
of a Daimio, it is not necessary to bring the case to Yedo.</p>

<p>If the servants of a Daimio kill the servant of another
Daimio the case must be brought before the Gorochiu.</p>

<p>If a Daimio has no island or place fit for transportation,
the criminal’s relatives are bound to keep him in confinement.</p>

<p>The above is a sketch of the cases which may come before
the criminal department of the Hio jo shio.</p>

<p>Hio jo shio russui are four officers who have charge of
the building when not used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>Ro ban.—Keeper of the prison (roya). The execution-ground
is at the southeast corner of the prison, under a willow-tree
in front of the back gate. The office of executioner
seems to be hereditary. Kubikiri Asayaymon is at present
the executioner, and it is said that his son at fourteen could
cut off a head at a blow. The prison is surrounded by a
high embankment, to prevent fires reaching it. If a fire
occurs within the building the prisoners are all liberated,
and those who return have their punishment mitigated.</p>

<p>Jowo ro sama.—These are female officers. They are
twelve daughters of Koongays in Miako, who reside in the
palace at Yedo to superintend all the females, servants, etc.,
and to look after their manners and morals. They are always
unmarried while in office, but sometimes marry Daimios.
They generally come to the palace young, and are
instructed there in their duties. They have the opportunity
of having great power, being at liberty to write to Miako
about anything they may deem improper either in the conduct
of the ladies, women, or men of the court of Yedo, or
of the Shiogoon himself.</p>

<p>Officers employed in situations at a distance from Yedo.—There
are six main roads or entrances to Miako; over each
of these the Shiogoon places a guard under a Daimio, maintaining
in addition a guard in the city itself. With the Shoshidai
there are nine Daimios resident in Miako.</p>

<p>Shoshidai.—This is the representative of the Shiogoon at
the court of Miako. It is an office requiring much tact and
independence of character. Formerly it was held by one of
the more powerful Daimios, but it was found that the tendency
to be won over to the party of the Emperor was great,
and it is now generally intrusted to a Fudai. His duty is
to act as a go-between or embassador to the imperial court,
and at the same time report to Yedo all changes. He does
not address himself personally to the Emperor, or even to
the Kwanbakku, but to the Tenso, the officer deputed for
that purpose, and who in turn is at times sent to Yedo as
envoy from the Emperor. The office is one which entails<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
great expenditure, but it is one in which personal influence
may be largely used for the furtherance of intrigue and the
acquisition of power. When Sakai was made Shoshidai,
the Shiogoon gave him an addition to his income of 10,000
koku per annum. He fell into disgrace with the Emperor,
and committed suicide in 1862. The Emperor accused him
of telling him falsehoods, while Sakai did not know that the
accounts furnished him were not true. Had he not committed
suicide, his property would have been taken from
his son. His father committed suicide also as Shoshidai
at Miako in the time of Kokaku, grandfather of the present
Emperor.</p>

<p>Miako matchi boonio.—Two officers, governors of Miako,
under the Shiogoon, whose duties are similar to those of the
governor of Yedo.</p>

<p>Kinri tsuki.—Two officers who act as messengers between
the imperial officers and the Shoshidai.</p>

<p>Nijio dzei ban.—The castle of the Shiogoon in Miako is
called Nijio. Two Daimios, and men under them, are appointed
guards or governors of the castle.</p>

<p>There is a keeper of the storehouses in Miako belonging
to the Shiogoon; also a keeper of the weapons of war, guns,
great and small, and an officer who superintends the boats
on the Yodongawa, the river running past Miako, to give
out licenses and receive the payment.</p>

<p>Fushimi boonio.—A Daimio, governor of the town of
Fushimi, near Miako. Here Taikosama resided, and built
the costly palace which was destroyed by an earthquake.
All Daimios have or had residences at Fushimi.</p>

<p>Osaka jiodai.—Governor of the town of Osaka.</p>

<p>Jiobang.—Keeper or warden of the castle of Osaka, built
by Taikosama.</p>

<p>Dzeibang.—Captains of the guards in that castle. Two
Daimios take this duty.</p>

<p>Kabang.—Four Daimios. These three last officers are
all together keepers of the castle of Osaka.</p>

<p>Osaka matchi boonio is street governor of Osaka.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>Funate is head officer over the boats and boatmen.</p>

<p>Kohoo, or Kofu.—The capital town of Kahi province, or
Koshiu, where the Shiogoon has a large castle, built by Takeda
Singeng. Hattamoto that have fallen into the black
books of the government for vicious conduct, or immorality,
drinking, etc., are sent to this castle. Sometimes as many
as 500 Hattamoto are there in a sort of arrest, under surveillance
before being again employed.</p>

<p>Nagasaki boonio.—Governors of Nagasaki, of whom there
are two, and two Daikangs to look after the lands belonging
to the Shiogoon. Nagasaki and the land in the vicinity and
the island of Amakusa belong to the Shiogoon.</p>

<p>Narra boonio.—Governor of Narra, the ancient and ecclesiastical
capital of Japan, a short distance from Miako.</p>

<p>Soonpu (Suruga no fu) is the castle of Suruga, built by
Imangawa, and occupied by Iyeyas some years before his
death, and afterward occupied by the ex-Shiogoon, Yoshi
hissa. There is a governor of the town and castle. At one
time the treasury of the Shiogoon was kept at Soonpu.</p>

<p>Suruga kabang.—One military Daimio. One of the
Shiogoon’s physic gardens for medicinal herbs is at Soonpu,
in charge of an officer.</p>

<p>Kowo no san.—Tombs of some of the early predecessors
of the Shiogoon. Iyeyas was buried at Nikko, in Simotsuki,
a day’s journey north of Yedo. There is an officer in charge
of the tombs at both places; where there are also, as officers,
a keeper of accounts and a gatekeeper. In the province of
Isse, at the great temple there, the Shiogoon is represented
by an officer, Yamada boonio. Over the town of Sakkai,
near Osaka, is a governor.</p>

<p>Ooraga boonio.—The “gate” or seaport of Yedo below
Kanagawa, in the bay of Yedo, has two governors. At
Ooraga all junks and boats are examined by custom-house
officials.</p>

<p>Sado boonio.—Two governors of the island of Sado,
where are the gold mines.</p>

<p>Neegata boonio.—One governor of the town. This port<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
formerly belonged to a Daimio, Makino Bizen no kami, but
about the year 1840 the Shiogoon displaced him, and gave
him Nangaoka, in Etsingo, in place of Neegata. It was
alleged that an illicit trade was being carried on between
Corea and this port, and also with the Dutch. It is said to
be a fine harbor, and was one of the ports opened to foreign
trade by treaty; but the harbor was found, or supposed to
be, too shallow for large ships. It has fallen off considerably
in trade and wealth since government took possession
of it.</p>

<p>Nikko boonio.—At Nikko Hill is buried To sho goo, or
Iyeyas, the first of the dynasty, and a fine temple (Chiu
senji) is erected near the tomb. The actual tombs of heroes
and great men in Japan, as has been said, seem to be generally
very modest and unassuming memorials. From the
roof of the temple at Nikko is hung a large chandelier presented
by the Dutch. The Shiogoons after Iyeyas are buried,
some at the Shibba, a temple in Yedo, some at Ooyayno
or Toyay san, another large temple in Yedo; others at
Kowono san; and at Zozoji, in Yedo.</p>

<p>Gai koku boonio.—Ministers for foreign nations. These
officers were appointed in consequence of the opening of the
country, and their duty is to communicate with the consuls
or ministers of foreign nations on international questions,
or matters connected with trade. They are Hattamoto of
rental varying from 150 to 3,000 koku per annum.</p>

<p>Kanagawa boonio.—There are two Hattamoto, governors
of this village, now risen into importance. The one is
a man of 5,000 koku, the other of 1,200.</p>

<p>Seki sho.—In the different provinces of Japan there are
passes upon the roads, where, by reason of the surrounding
hills, the road may be easily defended by a small force.
These are considered the keys of the country, and at each
place barriers (seki) are erected and guards appointed.
These are important from a military point of view.</p>

<p>In the province of Segami there are six seki or barriers.
Okubo kanga no kami, Daimio at Odawara, has charge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
them. They are—Hakonay upon the Tokaido, Neboo kawa,
Yangura sawa, Sengo ku bara, Kawa mura, Tanega mura.</p>

<p>In the province of Towotomi there are three gates—Imangiri,
Arai and Kenga.</p>

<p>In Kowotsuki are fourteen barriers—Fkushima, Goshina,
Owo watari and another, Oossui, Yoko-ngawa, Koori, Kawa mata,
Sarunga harra, Owo sassa, Dai-ïto, Kari jigu,
Minami maki, Tokura.</p>

<p>In Etsingo province are five barriers—Itchi foori, Hatchi
dzaki, Seki ngawa, Mooshi kawa, Yama ngootchi.</p>

<p>In the province of Sinano six—Kin oochi ji, Nami aï, Obi
kawa, Ono ngawa, Fkushima, Ni engawa.</p>

<p>In the province of Simosa four—Seki yado, Matsudo,
Fusa kawa, Nakatta.</p>

<p>In the province of Musashi four—Kobo toki, Ko iwa,
Itchi kawa, Kana matchi.</p>

<p>In the province of Owomi three—Yama naka, Yana
ngassay, and another.</p>

<p>At these barriers no woman is allowed to pass without a
passport from the governor of Yedo. No Daimio is allowed
to bring cannon or muskets past a barrier without permission.
Guards are stationed at each, to examine every young
person as to sex. This is done in order to keep the wives
and families of Daimios at Yedo.</p>

<p>In Sinano province there are large forests, the property
of government, on the Kisso hills, under charge of a Hattamoto.</p>

<p>Koondai (Kiun tai) is an officer who has the superintendence
of all the Shiogoon’s land in the different provinces in
which it lies. One officer has generally the lands in two or
more provinces under his care.</p>

<p>Dai kwan are smaller and lower offices, with duties similar
to and under the Koondai. They look after the ground
and crops on the ground belonging to government. They
calculate the amount payable by rice fields. To ascertain
this they frequently cut a tsubo (six feet square) dry, and
thrash it, and calculate the product of the whole field therefrom.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
They receive the rents, make leases, and act as factors
on government lands. There are thirty-seven Dai kwan.</p>

<p>The Officers of the Mint.—The mint in Yedo is in Drio
ngai tcho. It is under the superintendence of the treasury
governor. There is the Kinsa, or the department where gold
is coined; and the ginsa, the mint for silver coins. Deposits
of silver and gold are found in several parts of Japan, but
the most of the gold used by government comes from the
island of Sado; the silver is brought from Ikoo no gin sa
in Tajima, and from Iwami province. In some of the territories
of Daimios there are large quantities extracted, as in
the lands of Satsuma and Sendai. The latter has the right
of coining money, but the coin seems to circulate only within
his own territory. Silver and gold, as bullion, are much
cheaper relatively to coin than in almost any other country:
this arises probably from that peculiarity in the laws and
customs of Japan—the Tokusayay, previously mentioned—which
prevents the natives using either metal as ornaments,
or in any useful way. A good deal of gold must be used in
the manufacture and ornamentation of the lacquer-ware,
which is sometimes profusely covered with gold; but, except
for this purpose, there is little or none used, as the ladies do
not wear jewelry of any kind—neither earrings, nor rings,
nor brooches. No plate is used at their dinners. Owing to
this, no one can put the precious metals, if they have any in
their possession, to any use, and the owner, in order to realize
their value, must take them to the only market, which is
government. The government thus has the power of declaring
what value it will put upon these precious metals, and
pays accordingly for silver bullion thirty per cent below the
value which is afterward put upon the coin.</p>

<p>Lastly, among the establishments kept up by the Shiogoon
is the Nishi maro, literally the west round, the oldest
part of the shiro of Yedo. It was built by Owota do Kwang,
as mentioned before. The castle is surrounded by a broad
moat filled with water. On the inner side a fine steep bank
of grass slopes up from the water’s edge to such a height as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
entirely to conceal the interior. The water is brought from a
considerable distance—from the Tama ngawa River—being
led in a canal known as Tama ngawa jo sui. This was made
by Iyay Mitzko, the second after Iyeyas, and is under the care
of the Owometski and Kanjo office. The Nishi maro is
intended for the occupation of the child or children of the
Shiogoon, or for his father if he have abdicated. It is therefore
frequently empty, and in that case officers have charge
of the building, who are known as Nishi maro russui.</p>

<p>Within the circuit of the castle grounds are the residences
of the Gosankioh—the three princes, Stotsbashi, Tayass, and
Saymidzu.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>THE DAIMIO CLASS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the official list of Daimios published at Yedo the pedigree
of each is given; the family name and descent; the
period when the title commenced; the sons and daughters,
with the names of their wives and husbands; where his
residence in Yedo is situated, and likewise his houses in
Miako, Osaka and Fusimi; the date of his accession to the
title; who his wife is; his coats-of-arms, of which each
Daimio has two or more; the presents he is to make to the
Shiogoon both during the year when he resides in Yedo and
during that when he resides at his provincial residence; the
presents the Shiogoon makes to him on his coming to Yedo;
how his communications are to be carried on with the Shiogoon
and Gorochiu; the shape and color of the leather covering
of his official spears carried before him, as the spear-points
are always carried covered with leather; the uniform
or livery of his retainers; the title of his eldest son; the
names and titles of his large retainers, or Byshing; the mattoyay
or solid ensign carried in his train, the flag he carries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
on his ships, and the large mark upon his sails; the
amount of his territorial income; the provinces in which
his property lies; the distance of his residence from Yedo;
the room in the palace of the Shiogoon to which he goes; the
temple in which he is buried.</p>

<p>In the official list the Daimios are classed by families
(Kay), from many of which families there are cadets or
offshoots.</p>

<p>At the head of the Daimios stand the San Kay, “three
families,” Owarri, Kii, and Mito. Iyeyas in his laws calls
the first two from their cities, Nagoya and Wakayama.
There are four provinces from which two Daimios at one
time are not permitted to take a title—Mootz, Mikawa, Musashi
and Etsigo. No Daimio is allowed to take his title
of Kami from any of the three provinces, Kadsusa, Hitatsi,
or Kowotsuki—they are reserved for the imperial family.</p>

<p>Of these Daimios, three are generally known as greater
Kokushu; viz., 1, Kanga; 2, Satsuma; and, 3, Sendai.
Fourteen are called lesser Kokushu: 4, Hosokawa; 5, Kuroda;
6, Aki; 7, Nagato Mowori; 8, Hizen Nabeshima; 9,
Inaba Ikeda; 10, Bizen Ikeda; 11, Isse no Tzu, Towodo;
12, Awa, Hatchiska; 13, Tosa Yamano ootchi; 14, Sataki;
15, Arima in Tsikugo; 16, Nambu; 17, Ooyay Soongi. Four
are new Kokushu: 18, Etsizen; 19, Tsuyama; 20, Idzumo;
21, Aidzu.</p>

<p>This list comprehends all those who are supposed to be
capable of taking an active share in the government of Yedo,
or in ruling their own districts in the interest of the present
dynasty of Shiogoons.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> When from any cause, such as age
or infirmity, a Daimio is incapacitated from attending to his
duties at Yedo, or when he becomes tired of the trammels of
State to which he is subjected, he may abdicate, and hand
over the dignities or the more irksome part of the duties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
of office to his son. If he be suspected of intriguing against
the powers of the State, he may be displaced, and the title
taken from him and given to some relative, or any one to
whom the Shiogoon may be pleased to give it. It seems
but rarely that any steps are taken against the person of
a Daimio, further than ordering him into arrest in his own
house, which his successor is often too glad to carry into
effect. In the case of a Daimio being accused or convicted
of any great crime, he may offer to shave his head and
become a Buddhist priest, and so avoid any further consequences.
The difficulty of seizing a man of rank in his own
territory has probably led to these compromises. Therefore
the government tries to act through the interest of the retainers
to obtain submission to its decrees. And it is only
when a man is powerful enough and wealthy enough (with
personal ability to boot, as in the case of Choshiu in 1866) to
carry on war, that it becomes necessary to take up arms, and
then nothing short of civil war can be the result.</p>

<p>As a consequence of this state of things, there is a large
number of persons in Japan who have been Daimios, but who
are in a position, real or nominal, of retirement from the
world and its cares. These are the fathers or brothers or relatives
of those who now hold the title, and who have probably
been put in to fill the position on account of their tender age.
Many no doubt thus retire of their own free will; but the
disturbances consequent upon Ee Kamong no kami’s vigorous
action in 1857 forced others to give up the title and
place in order to save them for their family. Others have,
for the same object, committed suicide.</p>

<p>Daimios who have thus retired into private life are called
Inkio (Chin., “Yin ku”)—<i>i.e.</i>, retired into privacy. He is
thenceforth known generally by the name of his castle or
province, with the word for “late” or “formerly,” saki no,
prefixed to the highest title which he bore.</p>

<p>In 1862 there were 104 of these Inkio Daimios, whose
names are given at the end of the peerage, and of whom the
following are most prominent:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>1. Owarri, saki no Chiunagoong.—This is the Daimio
who was degraded by the regent.</p>

<p>2. Mimasaka, saki no Chiujo.—This is the thirty-fourth
child of the eleventh Shiogoon, and known as Kakudo.</p>

<p>3. Akashi, saki no Shosho, is also a son of the Shiogoon,
and was adopted by Matzdaira Hiobu no tayu.</p>

<p>4. Ooajima, saki no Shosho. His son is also on the retired
list.</p>

<p>5. Etsizen, saki no Chiujo Shoongaku.—He was degraded
by the regent, but was restored, and afterward became regent
or Sosai.</p>

<p>A Buddhist name is at times adopted when he does not
wish to continue to bear a title.</p>

<p>When he has shaved his head and becomes a priest, he
is called Niudo; <i>i.e.</i>, entered the path of Buddha.</p>

<p>Keng, Sei, Ang, and Eeng are Buddhist titles taken by
those who have retired from the world.</p>

<p>The Hattamoto—literally, “the root or foundation of the
flag or army.”—This rank was formerly called Shiomio,
“small names,” in contradistinction to Daimio, “great
names.” The Hattamoto are officers of the Shiogoon’s
government, who in rank and emoluments come next to
the Daimios. Hattamoto are eligible to fill all the offices
in the different departments of the Yedo government under
the Gorochiu (to which Daimios alone are appointed). When
it is wished to put a Hattamoto into the Cabinet, he is first
given by the Shiogoon territory equivalent to 10,000 koku
per annum. A Hattamoto may be described as an officer
of the government in the possession of land valued from 500
to 9,999 koku. Officers with less than 500 koku are below
Hattamoto, and known as Go kennin; and beneath them
are Ko jiu nin. Lower still are the account-keepers; Oto
torimi, bird-keepers; Okatchi, spies and men about the
kitchen; and Yoriki and Do sin. Hattamoto are generally
of the fifth rank, or Shodaibu, and never of the fourth. Some
Hattamoto have titles from the Emperor, others have titles
of provinces, as Daimios have, but those who have any titles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
are a small minority of the whole number. Some Hattamoto
receive titles for one generation only, known as Itchi dai
Yoriaï. The class is divided into large and small—the former
having from 3,000 to under 10,000 koku of land; the
latter from 500 to 3,000. They are divided into—</p>

<p>1. Kotai Hattamoto, or those who go to Yedo on alternate
years.</p>

<p>2. Yoriaï.</p>

<p>3. Ogo bang.—These live in or have charge of a castle,
such as Kofu, Soonpu, etc.</p>

<p>4. Shingo bang.—These act as guards to the Shiogoon
in Yedo.</p>

<p>5. O niwa bang.—These are keepers of the gardens, are
generally spies, and consequently avoided by other officers.</p>

<p>Some of the principal families of Hattamoto are the
following:</p>

<p>Soonga numa, with 7,000 koku, at Shinshiro, in Mikawa
province. An old family, proud of the family name.</p>

<p>Matzdaira Hissamatz is a relative of Matzdaira Oki no
kami, related to the Shiogoon’s family, and uses the Awoee
or crest of the Shiogoon, with 6,000 koku; lives at Izassa in
Shimosa.</p>

<p>Takanoya Matzdaira is the lineal descendant of the Nitta
family, with 4,500 koku; lives at Nishingori in Mikawa.</p>

<p>Ikoma Tokutaro was, in the time of Taikosama, a powerful
Daimio, is now a Hattamoto with 8,000 koku, living at
Yajima in Dewa.</p>

<p>Yamano Mondo no ske, also a descendant of the Nitta
family; was, in the time of Ashikanga, powerful, with 6,700
koku; resides at Mura oka in Tajima, is considered a good
family, and, as related to the Shiogoon, has special privileges.</p>

<p>Hirano.—His ancestor, H. Gonpe, was a noted warrior
in Taikosama’s time. The family is much respected, has
5,000 koku, and lives at Sawara moto in Yamato.</p>

<p>Kinoshta.—Calls himself of the line of Taikosama, with
5,000 koku. His castle is Tateishi in Boongo.</p>

<p>Yamazaki.—Formerly a powerful family, now with 5,000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
koku; resides at Nariwoo in Bitsjiu; is descended from the
third brother of Hatchimang taro.</p>

<p>Mongami, lineally descended from Ashikanga, is looked
upon as a Kokushiu; resides at Owomori in Owomi, with a
revenue of 5,000 koku.</p>

<p>Kowotsuki, at Kowotsuki in Owomi, with 4,700 koku,
is the lineal male descendant of the Ooda Genji line.</p>

<p>Besides these Hattamoto, there are Kotai Yoriaï, who
are landed proprietors of very old families, but who are as
Tozama, and take no part in affairs, such as—</p>

<p>Nassu, a very old family in Shimotsuki.</p>

<p>Mikawa shiu, the line of Iyeyas’s family.</p>

<p>Nakajima Mayra was found in the Mayra district in
Kiusiu.</p>

<p>There are, besides these, Hattamoto, styled Hira Yoriaï,
with revenues from below 10,000 koku downward, such as—</p>

<p>Minagawa, with 9,000 koku.</p>

<p>Seigo, and others.</p>

<p>Kondo nobori no ske, with 5,400 koku, who is looked
upon as first Hattamoto, not by rank, but because he refused
to take the rank of Daimio from Iyeyas when offered
to him.</p>

<p>Koozai, Foonayoshi.—These two are very wealthy. They
were formerly engaged in trade with the Portuguese in the
sixteenth century.—And many others, with incomes gradually
decreasing to 500 koku per annum.</p>

<p>Hattamoto officers have generally been employed on interviews
with foreign embassadors, or as embassadors to
foreign courts on the conclusion of treaties.</p>

<p>Those who negotiated the treaty with Lord Elgin in 1858
were—Midzuno Tsikugo no kami, a low Hattamoto. He
was afterward disgraced, but in 1862 was appointed governor
of Hakodadi, and looked upon as a shrewd, wily man.—Nagai
Genba no kami was also a low Hattamoto. He
was also disgraced in the changes which followed, but in
September, 1862, was appointed Sa kio, or street governor
of Miako.—Inooyay Sinano no kami was the minister for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
naval affairs—was of low origin, the son of a Gokennin. He
negotiated the treaty with Mr. Harris, United States Minister.
He was in 1862 made a governor for foreign affairs.—Hori
Oribay no kami was considered an upright man and
just in his dealings. After the part he took in signing the
treaty, he got into difficulties with Ando and Koozay in the
Gorochiu, and committed suicide.—Iwase Higo no kami,
a low Hattamoto, a very cunning man, since dead.—Isuda
Hanzaburo was an obscure Gokennin.</p>

<p>The Dutch treaty was signed by Nagai Genba no kami;
Okabay Suruga no kami, a low Hattamoto; and Iwase Higo
no kami.</p>

<p>The Portuguese treaty was signed in 1860 by Misono-gootchi
Sanuki no kami, a high Hattamoto—he was appointed
in 1862 general in command of the castle of Osaka;
Sakkai oki no kami, a Hattamoto with 2,000 koku—he is
now governor of the exchequer in Yedo; and Matzdaira
Djirobe—had office in 1862 in the castle Kofu.</p>

<p>The embassadors who visited Europe were of the rank
of Hattamoto: Take no ootchi, Simotski no kami, and others.
The embassies were accompanied by agents from the
more powerful Daimios, such as Satsuma, Choshiu, and
others, who reported their observations to their own masters.</p>

<p>The Kokay, or Kowokay, as has been before stated, is a
class which is looked upon as intermediate in rank between
Daimios and Koongays. They are not permitted to take
part in the affairs of government. They are the representatives
of old families, and receive pay from government. The
class is divided into Kimo iri kokay and Omotte Kokay.</p>

<p>Among the former are Hatake yama. His ancestor was
a partisan of Yoritomo; his tomb is at Kamakura.—Toki,
a general of Ashikanga’s time.—Yura, a powerful family
in the time of Ashikanga.—Otta, the lineal descendant of
Nobu nanga.—Rokaku; in the time of Yoritomo known as
Sassaki.—Arima, related to Arima, the Roman Catholic.—Imagawa,
formerly lord of Surunga, and builder of Soonpu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
castle; defeated by Iyeyas.—Takeda, of the family of T.
Singeng, who fought against Iyeyas. And others.</p>

<p>Of the Omotte Kokay—There are Owotomo, of the family
of Owotomo Boongo no kami, the great patron of the
Jesuits in the sixteenth century. At one time a very powerful
family, possessing the greater portion of the island of
Kiusiu, before the power of Satsuma rose to a height. The
fortunes of the family fell with those of the Jesuits; and to
the league formed against these foreigners, the confiscation
of the extensive property of Owotomo was the stimulus to
energy and the reward of victory.—Ooyay sungi was very
powerful in the province of Etsingo, and the family for long
held the office of Kwanrei at Kamakura. The direct descendant
of the Nitta line was Jera matz manjiro. He was
naturally a proud man, and refused to come to Yedo when
Iyeyas invited him, and, in consequence, he lost his position;
but the other Daimios, who trace their origin to the
same source—the Nitta family—support him in a position
equal to themselves.</p>

<p>The class of officers next below the Hattamoto is the
Gokennin. The highest income they receive from government
is less than 500 koku per annum.</p>

<p>Beneath the Gokennin, officers come under the general
classification of Yakunins or officials—literally, “business
men.” This name is applied to the lower officers employed
by the Shiogoon—such as Kumi gashira, Shirabbe yaku,
Jo yaku, and Shtabang. There are no Yakunins in Miako;
there the Emperor’s sub-officials are called Kwannin.</p>

<p>Every Yakunin is supposed to swear that he will do whatever,
right or wrong, he is ordered to do by his government.</p>

<p>It is not permitted to Gokennin, or to officials of lower
rank, to ride in Yedo or upon the highroads; they must walk.</p>

<p>Such being the details of the officers under the Shiogoon,
the government is so well regulated as to have worked with
comparative smoothness for 250 years. The safeguards and
checks which were devised by Iyeyas have been in operation
up to recent times. The setting apart of three families from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
the members of which the Shiogoon might be chosen, gives
a powerful support to the reigning family. The designation
of four families, from out of which a regent might be appointed,
and the further naming of thirteen families from
out of which the Cabinet was advised to be formed, out of
the broader basis of 135 Fudai or working Daimios, who
were generally comparatively poor, gave to all the higher
classes a consistency of interest in the existing state of things.
Power over the person of the individual, and over his personal
power of mischief, in regard to the more powerful
princes, was sought to be obtained by the detention of the
wives and families in Yedo, and by visiting the sins of an
intriguing prince, not upon his family or retainers, but upon
himself alone. It would appear that when the Shiogoon is
of age, and of sufficient capacity, he will appoint his own
ministers out of the different families named by Iyeyas to
this end. It is to the interest of the State as well as of the
Kokushiu that they should continue unmolested in the possession
of their extensive territories and jurisdiction; and
intrigues are prevented as far as possible by no one being
allowed to visit another within his territories. While the
power which the government held over the persons and
property of these powerful princes, by having the wives
and families as hostages at Yedo, was promoted by the
wish for their welfare on the part of the husbands or parents,
it was kept in force by the strange custom of these
powerful lords coming up to the court at Yedo every alternate
year, or, in some cases, every six months. Perhaps
this was aided by the dullness of their country quarters compared
with the gayety of the capital. If the Shiogoon be
a minor, or incapable of holding the reins of power, the
ablest or the least scrupulous of those who have any claim
to the situation becomes regent, and he rules the empire for
the time being. A regency, however, has not been frequently
necessary during the rule of the present family,
but the appointment has never been held by one man for
more than three years, and the tenure, it is said, has generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
been terminated by assassination. The regent removes
his political foes, and appoints in their place men
holding his own views. He carries himself as a ruler over
men who are his superiors in wealth and rank—the Ko
kushiu. These men are still obliged to repair to Yedo,
where they find, in place of an acknowledged superior, a
haughty inferior, to whom they must pay court. This is
one weak point of the system, and that upon which it threatened
to break up. This forms the last chapter of the history
of the empire.</p>

<p>The above is a sketch of the court of the Shiogoon, with
which one must be acquainted before the past history or the
current events in the empire can be thoroughly understood.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>THE HISTORY OF THE EMPIRE CONTINUED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> history of Japan, during the two and a half centuries
after the death of Iyeyas, presents a continuous narrative of
tranquillity and peace when contrasted with the stormy times
which preceded that era. The laws which Iyeyas made, and
the steps which he took, seem to have brought about the end
which he had in view; namely, establishing his own family
as <i>de facto</i> rulers of the empire, and placing them upon a
seat which should be too strong for any rival to overthrow.</p>

<p>The peace which was so happily granted to the empire
was so perfect and of such duration that in the year 1806 a
great national festival was held, when the nobles and people
congratulated the Emperor upon what was an unprecedented
fact in the history of Japan, and indeed it may be said of
any nation, an unbroken peace of nearly two hundred years.</p>

<p>The only subject of discord left behind him by Iyeyas at
his death was the question of the treatment of the foreigner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
in his twofold capacity of trader and missionary. The foreigner,
as a trader, Iyeyas wished to retain at his ports, in
order that he himself might enjoy the benefits of trade, and
keep himself acquainted with what was going on in the world
around him. The foreigners, as proselytizing missionaries,
bringing professions of peace and goodwill, but who seemed
to be in reality preachers of sedition and organizers of rebellion,
were not to be tolerated; and he came to the conclusion,
that if any real peace was to be obtained for the country, it
must be at the expense of the former. “Perish trade,” he
said, “that my country may have the greater blessing of
peace.” With the view of carrying out his plans, another
edict was, in the year 1616, promulgated against the Roman
Catholic religion, about which time the evidence of these
fathers would lead to the belief that, “from Taikosama’s
death, 1598, to the year 1614, the fathers of the Society baptized
upward of 104,000; and what is more, in the first three
years of the persecution, when the very pillars themselves
began to shake, they converted 15,000 more. By this time
the Jesuits had traversed the whole empire, and claimed
converts, not only in Yedo, but in Oshiu (or Mootz) and
Dewa to the extreme north. The province of Oshiu is separated
from Dewa by a long chain of high mountains all
covered with snow, and here it was that the poor exiled
Christians lived, destitute of all human assistance. One of
the Jesuits, moved with compassion at their misfortune, took
a journey into that country, climbing up the hills over hideous
precipices in deep snow. He visited privately the Christians
that wrought in the mines, and confessed and communicated
them. The same he did at the hospital of lepers,
which happened to be at that time full of Christians.” This
was, as we are told, done quietly, and by the assistance of
converts; but, as heretofore, while some of the different
orders of the Roman Church were disposed to keep quiet
till better times should dawn, and carry on their ministrations
in secret, as it were, others were still inclined to show
a zeal without knowledge, and thus kept up the ardor of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
their enemies about the court. During the year 1626 Midzu
no and Take naka were sent down to Nagasaki to examine
into and report upon the state of the Christian religion; and
the government, knowing that the Cross was the symbol of
the faith, and an object of the highest reverence among the
Christians, resolved to make the question of such reverence
the shibboleth or test of the individual strength of faith. In
1636 orders were issued by government that every one in
Nagasaki was to assemble each month for the purpose of
standing upon, with the object of desecrating, a copper “ita,”
or plate, with an engraven representation of the Christian
criminal God—<i>i.e.</i>, of our Saviour. This order was strictly
carried out at Nagasaki, while another such plate was (and
is) kept at Osaka for the purpose of testing suspected persons.
This act of desecration is known as “Yayboomi,” and
was carried out till the recent conclusion of treaties with
Christian nations.</p>

<p>This last device of the government appears to have been
successful in separating the Christian element from the
heathen; but it terminated in a way which was, perhaps,
not expected by the authorities; namely, in driving the poor
Christians of the island of Kiusiu to band together, and ultimately
in desperation to take up arms in their own defense.
Had the Christians resorted to this <i>ultima ratio</i> at first,
instead of leaving it as the last card they had to play, the
result of the game might have been different from what it
turned out to be. Refusing to perform such an act of irreverence
and desecration, they were obliged to fly to the hills
and band together for the common object of protection. The
numbers increased until they amounted to upward of 40,000
men. The most prominent leader among them appears to
have been Massida shiro, fourth son of Jimbe, in Kobemura,
in Hizen province; and he was assisted by two brothers,
Oyano Kozayaymon and O. Kemmootz. These are probably
the two brothers to whom Tavernier, the great Eastern
traveler, alludes in an appendix to his work, when he
mentions, on the authority of one Father Barr, who seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
to have been in Japan at the time, that “none were more
zealous or faithful to the Christians than the two lords of
Ximo, Francis and Charles, sons of the lord of Buzen.”</p>

<p>The Roman Catholics who had been recently forced out
of the city of Nagasaki and the town adjacent gathered
themselves together under the command of Massida, and
resolved to make a final stand in the island of Amacusa,
at that time belonging to Terasawa, formerly governor of
Nagasaki, and under the charge of his retainer Miako tobe.
The first move of this Christian army was to seize the castle
of Tomioka. This put them in possession of the island,
after which the army crossed over to occupy the castle
of Simabara, situated about twenty miles from Nagasaki,
and meditated an attack upon that town. The movements
of both parties seem to have been slow, as, after a delay of
twelve months, the government issued orders to the Daimios
of the island of Kiusiu to collect, equip and send forward an
army under the command of Itakura Suwo no kami to besiege
the castle and town of Simabara. Itakura, probably acting
upon the advice of his augurs, the Buddhist priesthood, attacked
the city upon the first day of the year, and was killed
in the attempt, when the command devolved upon Matzdaira
Idzu no kami, with Toda san mong and Matzdaira Sin saburo.
After sustaining a siege of two months, and repelling several
attacks, the Christians were at last overcome and the castle
was taken. The whole of the persons found in the city—men,
women, and children—were massacred, to the number
of 31,000. The three leaders were taken, together with a
woman, beheaded, and the heads put up on the gate of the
Dutch factor’s house at Hirado. After the affair was over,
the native accounts say that “the guns from Nagasaki were
of great use, therefore he presented money.” The factor at
the time appears to have been named Koekkebekker, and the
statement that money was presented implies in the native
account that it was given to the Dutch for the assistance
derived from their cannon, which are said to have fired from
a ship and a battery on shore 426 balls. A great deal has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
been made of this against the Dutch, as using their influence
to extirpate Christianity from the empire; but when
the guns were demanded by the Japanese, the Dutch factor
was powerless to refuse.</p>

<p>A few native vessels were at this time permitted to trade
with China, Hainan, Formosa, and Tonquin; and there
must have been a considerable number of Japanese collected
in Macao and its neighborhood, some probably traders or
runaway sailors, others as refugees on account of religion,
or as being educated for the priesthood. Up to a recent
period the remains of a large building with a garden-wall
were visible on the Lappa, opposite Macao, which was
known to the Chinese as the “Yut pone lao,” or Japanese
hall, now better known as the “Fan kwei lao,” or hall of
the outer devils.</p>

<p>According to native history, in the year 1640 some of the
“Jashiu mong” (one of the names by which the Roman
Catholic sect was known in Japan) came to Kagosima in
Satsuma. Orders were given to the inhabitants not to speak
to and not to listen to these foreigners. Two officers, Kangatsume
from Miako and Baba saburo from Nagasaki, were
ordered to investigate and communicate the result. They
found that “there were in one ship seventy-three men of this
sect; of this number sixty were beheaded, and the remainder
were sent to the islands.” This is the way in which native
authors put the arrival and treatment of four Portuguese
gentlemen who were sent as embassadors to Japan from
Macao in order to endeavor if possible by a last stroke to
reopen the trade which had been lost. The four gentlemen,
with their suite and the crews of the vessels to the
number of sixty men, were beheaded at Nagasaki, while
the remaining thirteen were sent back to Macao to inform
the authorities there of the treatment they had received.
In the Cathedral of Macao may be seen a painting of the
execution of these embassadors.</p>

<p>Deeply regretting the loss of the trade of Japan, and
nothing daunted by the fate of these envoys, King John,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
upon ascending the throne of Portugal after the separation
of the kingdom from the dominion of Spain, thought it a
good opportunity to attempt to reopen negotiations; and
with this view Don Gonzalo de Sequeyra was dispatched
with two vessels and numerous presents to pave the way.
He was, though more fortunate, not more successful than
those envoys sent from Macao. By the accounts of native
historians, “two black ships came to the island of Iwoga
sima, south of Satsuma. They said they were all Nanbang
men, and that there was not one Roman Catholic [priest?]
among them. The captain said, ‘My country’s king is now
changed. I have a dispatch from the new king, and I wish
it to be forwarded as soon as convenient to Yedo.’” Inooyay
and Yamagaki were sent from Yedo to make inquiries.
They demanded that the powder and guns should first of all
be given up, and then they would hear what the envoys had
to say. The captain replied, “‘Trading is a matter which
concerns all countries. If Japan does not choose to trade
with us, that is her affair, but the guns and powder cannot
be given up.’ Thereupon all the Daimios in the island of
Kiusiu were ordered to hold themselves in readiness with
men and boats. The name of the envoy was Kom sa aru,”
etc., in which an attempt was made to write his name in
Japanese sounds. He said he was a relative of the King of
Portugal. Answer was sent down from Yedo to the effect
that these ships had committed a serious offense, but that
they should be dealt leniently with, and were to be ordered
to leave the shores and not to return. After staying in all
forty-three days, the two vessels departed. They had two
captains and 400 men. The one was 156 feet long by 42
broad; the other was 144 feet long by 36 broad. Each vessel
had 20 large guns. After this visit orders were given to
the Kiusiu Daimios to have always in readiness a force of
55,000 men and 997 guard-boats for the protection of the
coasts. In the year 1666 another edict was issued against
the Roman Catholics, so that it would appear that some
sparks of the faith were still lingering here and there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
which the government feared might at any moment be
fanned into flame.</p>

<p>In the year 1709, Abbé Sidotti, an Italian priest of good
family, determined to devote himself to the cause, and to
make another attempt to regain Japan to the Church of
Rome. With difficulty he found a captain of a vessel trading
at Manila, who agreed to put him ashore on some point
of the coast, and there to leave him to his own resources.
When off the coast of Satsuma a boat was lowered, and the
abbé, with a few small coins in his pocket, was put on shore.
The boat returned, and the ship sailed away. After a long
interval, a report reached the Dutch factory, through Chinese,
that the abbé had been taken and immured between
two walls, and allowed to perish of hunger. But this has
lately been disproved by the discovery of a full account of
his arrest and examination, and detention about Yedo until
his death, which does not appear to have taken place for
many years. This was the last effort made by the Church
of Rome to regain the footing she had lost.</p>

<p>Hidetada, the son and successor of Iyeyas, would seem
not to have possessed the talents or firmness of his father,
but he had the advantage of his father’s advice and assistance
during the greater part of his rule. His son, Iyaymitz,
when he was capable of ruling, and had come to the office
of Shiogoon, found that the spirit of the Daimios had been
softened by the long peace. The yoke of the Tokungawa
family did not gall their necks, and they preferred peace
and ease in the assured possession of their estates, to the
risk and violence of wars and constant disturbance in the
empire. Iyaymitz on more than one occasion visited the Emperor
in Miako with great pomp, but a real or suspected
attempt to assassinate him seems to have put a stop to these
visits.</p>

<p>The year 1634 is given as the date at which the custom
of the Daimios visiting Yedo on alternate years commenced.
The Daimios coming to Yedo and returning from it are
spoken of as Sankin and Kotai. The custom seems to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
been long in use in Miako, but in a more temporary way,
and simply as being a duty of each lord to visit and pay his
respects at the imperial court once a year when they offered
presents. This visit was by Iyeyas transferred to his court
at Yedo and Soonpu; but it appears to have fallen into desuetude
and irregularity during the life of Hidetada. But
Iyaymitz, who was an able, proud, and precise ruler, found
that his father had not been much respected by the Daimios,
who still retained the recollection of the wars and prowess
of Iyeyas; but in course of time these men were succeeded
by their sons, who were of a more effeminate spirit, and had
no such associations. Iyaymitz, taking advantage of this
change, invited all the Daimios to visit him at Yedo, when
he proposed rules for their visiting and residing at his court,
to which they all agreed, swearing fealty, and signing the
deed each with his own blood drawn from above the nail of
the finger. A hall had been built on the Goteng yama, a
rising-ground near Yedo, in which the Shiogoon was to meet
the Daimios on their arrival; but under Iyaymitz the custom
was discontinued and the ground made public.</p>

<p>During the same year, the “Court of Deliberation,” the
Hio jo sho, was established in Yedo, with the view at the
outset of investigating charges brought against Daimios.
The Mayassu hako, or box for complaints, now standing
in front of the Hio jo sho, was not placed there till the
year 1721.</p>

<p>One Shiogoon after another succeeded to the throne, not
always without suspicion of unfair means being used to
hasten the conclusion of the reign. It is generally believed
that Tsuna yoshi was killed by his wife when he was on the
eve of proclaiming the son of Yanangi sawa, one of his ministers,
his successor. The heir was Iyay nobuko, the son of
the eldest son of Iyaymitz; the father, when a young man,
having been sent to the castle of Kofoo under arrest on account
of irregularity of conduct. In the year 1716, on the
death of the infant Shiogoon, Iyay tsoongu, a difficulty occurred
as to the succession, when Yoshi mone, who was of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
the royal house of Kii shiu, was selected by the Kokushu,
on the recommendation of Eeyee kamong no kami, then
Regent. Having abdicated in 1745, he died in 1751, and is
reputed as one of the ablest and wisest of the Shiogoons of
the dynasty. The next Shiogoon was Iyay hige; and during
the rule of his successor, Iyay haru, about 1765, a common
foot-soldier, Tanuma, rose to be chief minister, a position
and power which he used not only to gratify his own
evil propensities, but to disseminate the same corruption
over the empire. Preventing all communications with the
Shiogoon, he did what was right in his own eyes; forbade
all persons to study; changed the laws; and devoted himself
and the empire to debauchery. He was made a Daimio, and
placed at the head of the Cabinet. A conspiracy formed
against him failed, and the principal conspirators were beheaded;
but he was at length put down by Matzdaira Etsjiu
no kami, who published at this time the “Tenka hatto, mikka
hatto,” or three days’ proclamation over the empire.</p>

<p>The Japanese are proud of and delight in the beautiful
scenery of their country; and every one who has opportunity,
including nearly all the inhabitants, male and female,
makes a walking tour at some period of his life over the
country, visiting the more remarkable temples, which are
generally placed in favorable sites amid woods, and surrounded
by fine forest-trees, the immediate precincts being
kept with the most scrupulous care and nicety of gardening.
Nowhere are the temples more magnificent or the scenery
finer than about Miako; and it had been for long the custom
for the Emperor to go out and visit some one of the temples
in the neighborhood of Miako, and offer worship. In the
year 1722 a day was set apart in spring, and again in
autumn, on which the whole court should annually go out
on a sort of gigantic picnic—the Emperor drawn in a car
by oxen, and accompanied by all the Koongays—when they
visit some of the temples most renowned for their sanctity
or for the beauty of the grounds. This procession is called
Miyuki or Gokowo. There are two gardens adjoining the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
palace in Miako, Shoongakuji and Katsura, which are said
to be most exquisitely laid out and kept in beautiful order.
The gardeners who have the charge of these gardens belong
to a class or sect known as Gayra, a people who live apart
by themselves in a few villages in the neighborhood of the
capital. They are said to have kept themselves apart in
customs and religion for many generations. In religion,
they say there is but one God, and that all men below the
Emperor are equal. They, as Quakers with us, will not use
terms of respect to other men, such as “kudasare,” or call
men by titles, as “sama,” similar to “esquire”; saying that
they only adhere to old customs in so doing. They are
themselves respected as being of old and pure descent, and
their children are often selected by Koongays for adoption.
They principally follow the occupation of gardeners, or that
of breeders of horses.</p>

<p>In the year 1639, the Portuguese and Spaniards having
been expelled, and the Dutch factory alone left at Hirado,
the commissioner was ordered to remove his people and
offices to the small factory on Desima, “the Outer Island,”
at the head of the inlet of Nagasaki, and trade was prohibited
at all other places in Japan, and to any other nation,
with the exception of the Chinese.</p>

<p>In connection with the Dutch and their position on these
seas, the pirate commonly known as Coxinga is worthy of
notice. Koku seng ya, as he is known in Japanese history,
was the son of a Chinese, Ching tsing lung (Tayshi rio in
Japanese), by a Japanese woman. The father was for many
years, as pirate and admiral, the terror of the Chinese seas.
His son succeeded him in his former capacity, and reduced
the coasts of China to such a state of terror and devastation,
that an order was given, as a desperate remedy, that
every person should remove into the interior to a distance of
twelve miles from the shore, leaving the cities to decay and
the fields to waste. In 1647 Coxinga went over to Japan,
and offered his services to, or asked the assistance of, the
government in an attack he meditated upon China; but his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
application was refused. He seems to have again applied to
the government in 1658, when he turned his attention to the
island of Formosa. A large number of Japanese converts
had fled to this island, and the Dutch had built one or two
forts with the view of protecting a trade which they hoped
might grow up with China. In 1662 Coxinga attacked and
captured the fort Zelandia, putting to death nearly all the
Dutch soldiers, missionaries, and their wives and families.
Only a few men and some of the young women were not
killed. A curious but melancholy sigh is wafted over from
this long-forgotten remnant of Dutch Christianity and civilization
in a letter which was brought to Japan about the year
1711 by the captain of an English vessel who had touched at
Formosa on his way out; and as the letter comes through a
Japanese channel, there is no reason to doubt its authenticity.
The captain, in answer to interrogations, says, “There
is no war in Tonay [Formosa] now, and we have no trade
there. The Dutch head man asked me to give the following
letter to the Dutch commissioners in Nagasaki: ‘Please ask
Japan to help us; we are now shut up as in a prison, and
every day we weep. The names of the Dutch in Tonay are
[here the names are given in Japanese]. I hear that this
English vessel is going hence to Japan; therefore we take
the opportunity of sending this letter to you. The Tonay
country was seized many years ago; but we are still alive,
but we are in a most miserable state. Please help us to
return to our country. We pray you to speak to the Kogee
[Kubosama].</p>

<p>“‘Signed by the head man Yohang Hoorohooro, and
two others.</p>

<p>“‘There are ten women and several children here.’”</p>

<p>Nicolas Verburgh seems to have been the name of the
officer in command of the fort at the time of its capture in
1662, and the signature, as written by a Japanese, closely
corresponds to the pronunciation of the name, and Yohang
may have been his son John. From the tenor of the letter
it seems hardly possible to doubt but that these were some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
of the survivors of the Dutch captured in 1662; and if so, it
is curious to have such a fact coming to light through Japanese
informants, and melancholy to think of such a tedious
captivity lightened up after fifty years by the hope of once
more revisiting their home, and being redeemed from their
never-ending misery.</p>

<p>The name of this English ship is not given, but native
history tells us that the captain brought with him an exact
copy of the treaty or letter signed by Iyeyas, traced upon
paper, and expressed a wish to communicate with the Shiogoon
at Yedo. A Dutch interpreter was sent to see if there
were any Portuguese on board. The guns and muskets
were taken ashore. There were eighty-four of a crew on
board. The captain’s name was Sayemon Terohoo (Simon
Drew?). The ship was 114 feet long by 27 broad. Then
follows a list of articles on board—ammunition, which was
taken charge of by the Japanese: Gunpowder, 35 tubs; balls,
660; leaden bullets, 2 tubs; iron bullets, 1 tub; small stone
bullets, 8 tubs; matchlocks, 47; flint muskets, 23; spears,
24; swords, 339.</p>

<p>There were on board, as presents for the Shiogoon, “one
fine English musket, double-barreled, 3 feet 3 inches in
length; four muskets with very intricate and finely-made
locks, besides eight others which cannot be used, but are
very well made; and four molds for making balls.”</p>

<p>The cargo consisted of cotton, woolen and cotton cloth,
furs, fragrant wood, chintz, scented water, quicksilver, looking
glasses, tin, silk, crape, etc. The captain was interrogated
as to his religion, as to the Portuguese, and as to a change
he had made in the national flag which he sailed under,
which he explained by saying that he was told the Japanese
did not like the cross.</p>

<p>The Dutch had carried on their trade at the island of
Hirado, where an extensive land-locked bay is pointed out
as the harbor. They were ordered in 1639 to leave that
port, and in future to resort to Nagasaki, where a small
island, which was afterward connected by a bridge with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
town, was appointed them as a place of residence and for
trade, being about the same size as the factories at Canton
occupied by foreigners till 1856.</p>

<p>Several attempts were made by other nations, at long
intervals, to reopen a trade with the country; but it was
thought by the Dutch to be their interest to oppose any
such competition, and the Japanese themselves dreaded,
with good cause, any renewal of the former state of things.</p>

<p>The national annals during the period which elapsed between
the era of Iyeyas and the reopening of the country
advert to a number of occurrences of temporary and local
importance only. The comparatively trivial nature of these
tends to bring out into relief the continued quiet and rest
which the country has enjoyed under the form of government
established by Iyeyas, and after all complications arising
from dealings with other nations were forcibly put an
end to by the expulsion of foreigners.</p>

<p>The Daimio Fkushima Massanori was banished in 1619
to the island of Hatchi jo for a series of cruelties practiced
upon his family, his servants, and his people, which show
that he was deranged; and his extensive territories, occupying
three provinces, were confiscated.</p>

<p>In 1621 the Emperor married the daughter of the Shiogoon.</p>

<p>The temple of To yay zan was built in Yedo for the occupation
of the high-priest, who is alluded to in the laws of
Iyeyas as being appointed to fill that position as a near relative
of the Emperor, and one whom the Shiogoon may place
on the throne in case of rebels siding with the Emperor
in opposition to the Shiogoon. He is the most illustrious
personage in Yedo. The grounds are very beautiful, and
formerly belonged to the family of Todo.</p>

<p>In the year 1631, about the month of November, it is
curious to observe that the annals take notice of a prodigious
number of ironstones having fallen from heaven, showing
that the meteoric orbit has been crossing that of the
earth as visibly two hundred years ago as it does now.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
This occurrence probably took place during the day, as at
other times these meteors are spoken of as falling stars.</p>

<p>The aqueduct by which water is led from the Tamangawa
to Yedo, and thence discharged into the castle and
town by wooden pipes, was constructed in 1653. Proposals
have been made at different times to substitute iron pipes,
but the wooden ones still remain—a cause of constant expense
to the government.</p>

<p>The burning of the palace at Miako, or of that at Yedo,
is one of the most common occurrences in these annals.
Titsingh gives a vivid description of a conflagration which
occurred in 1788 in Miako, during which the attendants of
the Emperor killed more than a thousand persons before he
could be carried out of danger.</p>

<p>The government in Japan reserves the privilege of selling
weights and scales guaranteed by mark and certified as
correct. The weights as now used were settled in 1662.</p>

<p>In 1666 a new edict was issued against the Roman Catholic
religion; and in 1668 an order was promulgated prohibiting
any new Buddhist temples being erected. In all
probability the Buddhist priesthood had been exalted by
their victory over the Roman priesthood, and had again
acquired so much power as to be once more threatening to
disturb the equilibrium of the state. The zeal of individuals
had perhaps been again endowing new and enriching old
establishments, actuated by feelings with which the state
powers did not wish to sympathize. Only four years before
this edict, the enormous copper idol of Buddha at Miako had
been melted down and coined into copper “cash,” and a
wooden figure was substituted. If it be true, as is asserted,
that it was three or four times the size of the figure of Dai
boods, near Kamakura (at present existing in copper, and
upward of forty-five feet in height), it must have been of
considerable value in coin.</p>

<p>This edict against the erection of new temples is still in
force in Japan, and while it is aided by a growing want of
zeal in the hearts of the people, with a contempt for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
priesthood, it may be broken through by the permission
given to repair, or restore, or enlarge any temple already
existing, however small it may be; and as a temple or
shrine is standing upon nearly every knoll or eminence in
Japan, there can be no difficulty, were the funds forthcoming,
of raising such edifices as were raised of old by the zeal
of fervent worshipers.</p>

<p>The Buddhist priesthood in 1720, by a great religious
festival all over the empire, commemorated the eleventh
centenary of the establishment of Buddhism.</p>

<p>The Japanese claim the discovery and settlement of the
Bonin or Monin Islands in the year 1683. The name means
“no men,” or uninhabited. Attempts were made to colonize
the islands, but they seem to have failed; and some
English and Americans, with Sandwich Islanders, male and
female, succeeded them. But in 1862 the Japanese government
fitted out a vessel and carried away all these adventurers,
bringing them to Yokohama, and it seems to find
the islands a convenient distance to which they can send
vessels to train officers and men.</p>

<p>A work was commenced in 1786 which was expected to
have proved of great advantage to Yedo. This was the cutting
of a canal, and thereby joining several already existing
channels, by which a through communication would have
been opened up between Yedo, or the Bay of Yedo, and the
Pacific Ocean on the east coast. The part of the province
of Simosa between Yedo and the east coast is very low land,
and it is generally believed that at one time the sea cut off
the three provinces of Simosa, Kadsusa, and Awa, which
then constituted a separate island; and that the detritus
brought down, after a course of nearly two hundred miles,
by the largest river in Japan, the Tonay, has filled up with
alluvium the sea channel, leaving now only the passage for
the fresh water of the river. In the course of the filling up,
however, a large lake was left, the Een bang numa. About
twenty miles above Yedo, the Tonay, coming down as one
river from the Tonay district, divides into two. The one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
branch, receiving affluents from Hitatsi and the northern
provinces, runs due east as the Bando taro, or “eldest son
of Bando,” and enters the sea between Choshi and Itaku on
the east coast. The other branch, running south, enters the
sea to the east of the city of Yedo. The Okawa, or Great
River, runs parallel with the Tonay, and passes through
Yedo spanned by five bridges. Between the Okawa and
Tonay, and running parallel to, and communicating by
canals with both, is the Nakagawa or Middle River. By
these cross canal communications the passage may be made
from Yedo to the Pacific on the east, or to the northern
provinces by running up to Seki Yedo, where the bifurcation
takes place. It was proposed to deepen the lake, and
cut through a passage from it into the Bay of Yedo.—The
lower part of Yedo is so low that it is liable to be overflowed
should the Tonay rise above its banks. To avert this
danger, a large and important embankment, the Gongen do,
has been made at Koori hashi. Should this give way, the
whole of the lower parts of Yedo would be submerged, as
happened, it is said, in 1844.</p>

<p>The town of Sakura first started the project, and commenced
a canal, but did not finish the work. The Shiogoon,
seeing the advantages of the proposed cut, ordered the Daimios
to cut the remainder of this canal (of about fourteen
miles in length), each cutting as his share about 360 feet.
The work, which was immediately commenced, was in six
months half completed, when orders were given to cease
working at it. In 1843 the work was recommenced by
orders of government, but when it was within three thousand
yards of being finished it was again stopped, and it
continues in that position to this day.</p>

<p>The river and canal communications in Japan are more
ramified than the mountainous nature of the country would
lead one to expect. It is said that Yedo might, by short
canals, be put into water relations with Mito on the east
coast and Negata on the north, as boats can go up the Tonay
to Shimidzu, within eight miles of the navigable part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
Negata waters; while Miako might be joined by water to
Tsurunga on the north and Owarri on the south. By private
enterprise, in the year 1832, the Yodo ngawa between
Miako and Osaka was deepened and improved by the removal
of some rocks. It is said that the Katsura gawa, or
Hozu kawa, now a large affluent of the Yodo gawa, formerly
ran to the north through the province of Wakasa; but a private
individual, Yodo yo, cut a channel by which this river
now flows southward into the Osaka River. His family is
permitted to levy tolls upon the new channel.</p>

<p>The occurrence of fearful convulsions of nature is one of
the most remarkable circumstances in these annals; and it
may be presumed that only the most severe are noticed.
But recent observations go to show that almost every day
there is an observable motion of the earth at Yokohama
from subterranean causes. The native accounts of these,
with drawings, give an appalling idea of the suddenness
and the severity of earthquakes. In the year 1707 a very
severe earthquake shook the whole of the southern part of
the island of Nippon, and simultaneously from the side of
the mountain Fusiyama [Fusi—literally “not two,” or none
such] issued an eruption of volcanic matter. This eruption
continued for fifteen days; and at Yedo, a distance of seventy
miles, dust fell to the depth of two feet. Fusiyama
had not given any appearance of volcanic action for centuries.
The projection on the smooth outline of the hill on
the northwestern side marks the place where this action took
place, and is known as Ho yay zan. At the same time the
volcano Assama yama, in Sinano, broke out into violent action,
by which the two adjacent provinces were laid under
lava or dust. The same mountain broke out again in 1783,
and of the destruction done at that time Titsingh gives a
fearful account. He gives details of an earthquake which
occurred in 1793 at Simabara, during which a large portion
of the mountain was swallowed up; and the boiling
sulphurous springs of Onzen, memorable during the
persecutions of the Christians, were dried up. The fear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
of the inhabitants was quickened by the recollection of the
eruption of Assama yama, in Sinano, only ten years before.
The inhabitants, with their houses, were engulfed in the
openings of the earth; they were carried away by boiling
water issuing from the hill; they were killed by falling
stones and enormous rocks; they were surrounded and
burned by streams of fiery lava; they were drowned by
the stoppage of rivers. Some were found suspended from
trees, some on their knees, some on their heads in mud, the
streets strewed with dead bodies. The falling houses immediately
took fire, and the unfortunate inmates were burned,
or were confined prisoners. The outline of the coast was
completely altered, and the country converted into a desert.
A number of vessels were sunk at their anchors, and those
which tried to get away could hardly do so from dead bodies
and floating wood. Fifty-three thousand are known to have
perished in this earthquake in a comparatively thinly populated
district.</p>

<p>In 1828 a tremendous earthquake and volcanic eruption
took place in the province of Etsingo, during which, at
Nadatchi, a large mountain was engulfed and disappeared.
This province seems to be entirely undermined by fire.
The volcano Taka yama is called the entrance to hell. Oil
springs from the ground. Combustible gas issues in such
quantity as to be used for cooking and lighting, by simply
inserting pipes in the ground. Phosphorescent appearances
are seen in many parts. Soda is found in the province in
large quantities. Here many flint arrow and spear heads
have been found, exactly similar in shape to those found
in Europe.</p>

<p>The frequency of these earthquakes is a reason for nearly
all the habitations of man being built of wood; and by long
experience builders have arrived at certain modes of building,
by which the great danger of a house coming down
upon the inmates is in many cases obviated. They seem to
depend upon the roof for weight; and the piles upon which
this heavy roof rests are not fixed firmly into the ground,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
but some of them are fixed slightly into a square framework
of wood, laid on stone, while the others stand simply each
upon the surface of a large, round, hard, water-rolled stone,
which has been firmly imbedded in broken-down sandstone.
By this means the snap of a sudden shock is avoided, and
some slight motion is allowed. Whatever be the principle
upon which these houses are erected, it is wonderful to see
buildings, which seem to be put up in a shape the most ready
to topple over upon the least motion, withstand the shocks
of earthquakes for ages. There are pagodas in many parts of
the country of seven and even nine stories high. At Kamakura
is a temple with a narrow circular neck, above which
the eaves of a square roof project to about ten feet on every
side, resembling the projection of a Chinaman’s hat. If it
could withstand the wind, it could never be expected to resist
an earthquake; and yet it is said to be two hundred years
old, and seems as sound as when it was built.</p>

<p>The annals do not disdain to mention the visits of the
Emperor to witness theatrical exhibitions, or proceedings of
the Shiogoon in quest of sport.</p>

<p>The Japanese appear to be very partial to the theater,
and there seems in the nation an innate aptitude for such
representation. But while the government regulates this,
as it does every other branch of the amusements as well as
the education of the people, actors as a class are looked upon
as the lowest in the scale of society. The female parts are
generally taken by boys.</p>

<p>Some companies go about the country composed entirely
of boys or young children, none of whom are apparently
upward of ten or twelve years of age. The people enjoy
these very much, and will take their meals and sit all day
watching the different acts, applauding vigorously at whatever
they appreciate in acting, or what may amuse them in
the play. Nothing seems to excite their feelings and evoke
their applause more than a well-acted suicide by stabbing the
abdomen. During the evenings many minor places of amusement
are open, such as jugglers, marionettes, and tellers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
stories. Wrestling by professionals is another spectacle
which always draws a very large concourse of spectators,
generally male; but women are on occasions to be seen viewing
the maneuvers of the contest with the greatest interest.
These spectacles have been well, though perhaps over,
described by Commodore Perry. Besides these full-grown
wrestlers, companies go about, having under tuition boys of
from eight to twelve years of age, who wrestle with all the
pomp and circumstance of their full-grown compeers. The
same laws regulate the game under the formal umpire. A
successful wrestler is hailed with loud applause; and under
the influence of the excitement of the moment, money is frequently
thrown to the conqueror, or for want of it men will
throw their coats or napkins, which they afterward redeem.</p>

<p>The long peace subsequent to the time of Iyeyas, though
unbroken by any national disturbance, was not wholly free
from local events, which might, had they been fanned, have
broken out in serious trouble. In 1837, Osaka and the neighborhood
were disturbed by a rising which was instigated by
an officer, Oshiwo, who, by the distribution of money and by
placards, excited the people of the city against the authorities.
During the riot, which may be said to have lasted
only one day, nearly all the principal shops in Osaka were
pillaged and burned. The ringleader escaped, but was afterward
discovered, though he blew up the house in which he
was hiding before he could be arrested. Notwithstanding
that the government exercises such surveillance over the
people, and that one-fourth of the community seem to be
spies upon the remainder, risings of the people do occasionally
take place. These riots are especially frequent in the
provinces of Oomi, Sinano, and Kahi. In the latter, during
1838, a rebellion broke out which threatened to be somewhat
more formidable than usual. Several high officers and many
men on both sides were killed. In truth, in the province of
Kahi (or Koshiu) the people are great politicians and unruly,
and at the same time under some sort of volunteer organization.
Officers are in general somewhat afraid of an appointment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
to the province, as the farmers are wealthy, and keep
their servants well supplied with arms, which they teach
them how to use. A strong force is always kept at Hatchioji,
twenty-five miles from Yokohama on the road to Koshiu,
as a protection to Yedo.</p>

<p>In the year 1701 an occurrence took place which terminated
in a tragedy, and has ever since been one of the national
tales of revenge, which, though it was confined to a
few individuals, has conferred on them immortality, and the
admiration of their countrymen as heroes. Assano, a Daimio
from Ako, in the province of Harima, while within the precincts
of the Shiogoon’s palace, was insulted by a Kokay of
the name of Kira, when a quarrel and scuffle took place,
during which Assano drew his sword. This was looked
upon as such a heinous offense that he was ordered to kill
himself, when the government confiscated his property, reducing
his family and retainers to poverty. The retainers
(known as Geeshi), exasperated by this severity, banded
together for revenge, and forty-seven proceeded to the house
of Kira, when a fight commenced, which was carried on
during the whole night till the morning, by which time they
were able to penetrate to his apartment and kill him. The
whole forty-seven then proceeded in a regular and methodical
manner to commit suicide. They are all buried at the
temple of Sengakuji, near the temple first occupied by the
British Legation.</p>

<p>In 1672 the powerful Lord of Sendai was put to death by
his own servants. He also is memorable in Japanese story,
but more on account of his baseness and cruelty, which he
showed by a trait of character often chosen as a subject by
native artists. Being a man given up to debauchery and
the gratification of his passions, he became enamored of
Takawo, the most beautiful courtesan of Yedo at the time.
He wished her to accompany him to his castle in the north,
but she refused. She had an aversion to him, but the offer
of her weight in gold probably prevailed with her, or with
those in whose possession she was, to give consent. He took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
her with him, and on the way to his castle, upon asking her
if she was not happy, she replied that she was not, when in
a rage he drew his sword and cut off her head.</p>

<p>The occasions upon which European vessels communicated
with Japan during the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries seem to have been few, and at long intervals.
About 1637, Lord Waddell, with some ships, called in at
Nagasaki, but was not allowed to communicate with the
Dutch.</p>

<p>In 1673, 1768, 1791, 1793, 1796 and 1803, notices occur in
the native annals of the visits of foreign vessels.</p>

<p>In 1808, the “Phaeton” frigate, under Captain Pellew,
paid a visit to Nagasaki during the time when Holland was
at war with England. According to native accounts, the
captain wished to carry off the Dutch commissioner. For
that purpose he landed his men (in a boat made of leather?),
who displayed the usual playful habits of English sailors in
a foreign town, “striking everybody, and breaking everything
they could.” The Prince of Hizen was not on the
spot; the governor of Nagasaki was quite unprepared; the
Prince’s lieutenant proposed to burn the frigate by means of
fire-boats, but the frigate sailed before any steps could be
taken. The governor of the town, the Prince of Hizen, his
lieutenant and the guards, are all said, by native accounts,
to have committed suicide.</p>

<p>In 1813, during the time when Holland was absorbed by
France, Sir Stamford Raffles sent a vessel from Java with a
Dutch officer to take the place of the representative of Holland
then at Nagasaki; but the man in possession was able
to prevent his opponent landing, and held the place till he
was relieved in 1817.</p>

<p>In 1829, the “Cyprus,” a vessel containing some convicts
who had risen and murdered the crew, touched at Tanega.
The “Morrison,” which communicated with Japan shortly
after, heard of some foreigners who had landed on the island
of Tanega and forcibly carried off cattle.</p>

<p>In 1846, American vessels came to Nagasaki to beg permission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
to trade, and in 1849 some English vessels touched
at Uranga.</p>

<p>The native record of events concludes by stating that in
1858 treaties were concluded with five nations—American,
English, Dutch, Russian, and Portuguese—and that silver
boos were exchanged for dollars. That in 1859 the Regent,
Ee Kamong no kami, was assassinated; and the following
year was that year in the cycle in which, recurring once in
sixty years, it is permitted to women to ascend Fusiyama.</p>

<p>The history of the empire is now brought down to a very
important era, when relations with European nations are
about to be reopened, but, in comparison with her past experience,
at a great disadvantage to Japan, in so far as she
had to meet foes greatly in advance of herself in the practical
application of scientific investigation to the art of war,
and when she allowed herself further to be outwitted in the
diplomacy of treaty-making. The wars and animosities of
European powers had for a long time drawn them away
from the East and concentrated their attention nearer home;
and the history of their withdrawal from the Eastern Seas is
that of the struggle among European nations for the supremacy
of the sea.</p>

<p>The English retired from Japan as a field of trade about
the year 1623. The hatred of Holland to Spain and Portugal
gave vigor to her efforts, and she drove their ships from the
East, and remained in possession of the field, such as it was.
By driving away competitors, however, the Dutch undermined
their own position, and deprived themselves of support,
moral as well as physical, and fell gradually into a
position of contemptible dependence for the retention of
a worthless trade.</p>

<p>France appears to have made a feeble attempt, at the
time when Colbert was Minister, to open up a trade with
Japan, under the advice probably of Francis Caron, who
had been Dutch commissioner at Nagasaki. In Chardin’s
Travels may be seen a letter addressed to the envoy, giving
most minute instructions as to his conduct and treatment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
of the Japanese. Some of these might even be read with
benefit by envoys of the present day. “You shall keep your
finest clothes, and which you have never wore in Japan, as
shall likewise those of your retainers, till you are brought
to court, and till the day of your audience. As soon as you
shall arrive there, you shall cause your retinue to provide
themselves with little leather pumps and slippers. The floors
of the houses are covered with tapestry in Japan, for which
reason you must put off your shoes when you enter them,
and have some without quarters that you may quit them
with greater ease.”</p>

<p>The United States of America came late into the field
in Japan, but it may be said that the national action toward
Japan has had a wider cosmopolitan influence than any
other act since the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>The opening up of China, and the enormous trade which
followed in opium, silk, and treasure, caused by steam on
the one hand and the discovery of gold in California on the
other, together with the rapid advance in steam itself, all
combined to force a traffic around Japan, and to place these
islands on the very highway of commerce. It became every
day more obvious that from one side or other, either from
the English on the side of China, from the Russians on the
north, or from America on the east, some attempt must be
made before long to insist at least upon some measures of
civil behavior, if not of genuine hospitality, being shown
to vessels which required assistance, or which might be
wrecked upon the coasts of Japan.</p>

<p>In 1846 an attempt was made by the United States government
to endeavor to break down, if possible, the system
of exclusion kept up by Japan by the dispatch of two vessels
of war, under Commodore Biddle, with the view of feeling
the way toward a better acquaintance with the country.
The result was not satisfactory, the commodore having been
grossly and perhaps intentionally insulted.</p>

<p>Mr. Fillmore, the President of the United States, determined
to make another effort to break down the barrier, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
to make such a display as should show the Japanese that he
was to a certain extent in earnest, and at the same time prevent
any recurrence of such conduct toward his envoy. It
is needless to discuss whether the Dutch or the Russians had
any claim to priority of action in the matter. Commodore
Perry has endeavored to overthrow any such claims; but
such great political steps are seldom the result of a sudden
outburst of vigor—it was gradually approached from all
sides. It was, as has been said, one of the effects of the
great innovator, steam, with other concurring circumstances,
such as the opening of China and California, and the conversion
of the Pacific Ocean into a highway of commerce.
The breaking-up by British troops of the sham of the Chinese
as a military nation, no doubt opened the eyes of Western
nations. Japan lay in the way. No nation had a better
claim to ask it to relax its restrictions upon friendly grounds
than America. No nation was, perhaps, better suited to
carry out the diplomatic part of such a proposal, whether the
character of its officers as individuals, or the generally peaceful
professions on the part of the government, be looked at.
There can, further, be little doubt but that the United States
government was exceedingly fortunate or prudent in its
choice of the man for the work. He had some acquaintance
with Orientals learned in the school of China, and he brought
this to bear practically upon his present work. He says he
was convinced that, if he receded from any point which he
had once gained, such would be considered as an advantage
gained against him—that first-formed impressions among
such people carry most weight—that with people of forms it
is necessary to out-Herod Herod in assumed personal ostentation
and personal consequence—that a diplomatist ought
with such persons never to recognize any personal superiority,
and ought always to keep aloof from conversation or
intercourse with inferiors, and yet cultivate as far as possible
a friendly disposition toward the people.</p>

<p>Commodore Perry left the President’s letter on July 8,
1863, for the consideration of the Japanese government. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
returned in February, 1854, when the Japanese government
returned for answer that they had decided to accede to the
propositions of the President, and appointed five commissioners
to treat with Perry. The treaty was signed at
Yokohama, and ratifications were exchanged in February,
1855. Although the treaty was signed and the negotiations
brought to a successful termination, this was not accomplished
without difficulty and even danger, as, according to
native accounts, a large force was collected on the hills overlooking
Yokohama, under the command of different Daimios.
These forces occupied about fifteen miles of ground between
Fusisawa and Kawasaki to the number of a million of men
(but numbers are indefinite in the East). They seem to have
suffered a good deal from sickness while lying there, and
were afterward the subjects of many jokes and caricatures.
It was arranged that if any serious hitch took place, or any
appearance of force was exhibited on the part of the Americans,
a large bell was to sound, and other bells were to take
up the signal, and a general combined attack was to be
made. Idzu no Daikang volunteered to kill Perry with his
own hand, so deeply does personal feeling enter into national
questions in Japan; but this he was ordered not to attempt.</p>

<p>In 1854, during the Crimean war, Sir James Stirling,
then admiral on the China station, with H.M.S. “Winchester”
and a squadron, anchored in Nagasaki with the
object of concluding a treaty with Japan. The last article
of the treaty was to the effect that “no high officer coming
after to Japan should ever have power to alter this treaty.”
For this treaty the admiral received the thanks of the nation
through the House of Commons. It may by some be thought
a mistake not to have stood upon the old treaty given to
England by Iyeyas in the seventeenth century, which would
have been considered more binding upon the government and
upon the empire than a treaty made when the position of the
Shiogoon was once more being questioned.</p>

<p>These treaties were a step forward, but had this step not
been followed up they would soon have become inoperative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>Mr. Townsend Harris was appointed consul for America
at Simoda, and arrived there in 1856; and being in constant
intercourse with the Japanese authorities, he concluded a
convention by which further advantages were gained by the
Americans. The Japanese government thought that if the
further concessions brought no more trouble than what had
resulted from the little opening already made, they might,
without much danger, open the sluices a little more; and in
1858, Mr. Harris, after much negotiation, arranged the articles
of a commercial treaty (based upon the treaties with
China), which was signed by him and the Japanese commissioners
upon July 29, 1858. After this was settled, Holland,
Britain, Russia, and France concluded similar treaties.</p>

<p>The sound of the trumpets which had been blown to
herald the approach of the American squadron to the shores
of Japan had reached those shores long before the vessels
themselves. The government was informed through the
Dutch of the coming mission. The American government
does not seem to have intended anything further than ostentatious
display in the number and size of the vessels sent.
They did not propose to follow up a refusal to open their
doors, on the part of the Japanese, by any warlike operations.
But the Japanese government does not appear to
have been aware of this, and at the time they may have felt
some doubts as to whether their late treatment of foreigners
did not call for some display of power on the part of European
nations. Commodore Biddle had been grossly insulted
on board a vessel of war. The crew of one vessel had been
very unkindly treated, and, according to native report, more
than one vessel had recently been wrecked on the coasts of
Japan, and the crews treated with severity until they died
out. Until the squadron should arrive, the Japanese could
take little or no action. But they waited with much anxiety
the arrival of the expedition. It was considered as a most
important event, fraught with much either of good or evil to
the country—which was it to be?</p>

<p>There is a pamphlet, published in Yedo, which professes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
to give some account of the doings in Japan at this time,
and which is interesting as showing the internal state of
Japan at this most critical time in her history, and the feelings
with which the proposed opening of the country was
viewed by different political parties. The views of the Emperor
are set forth; the daring acts of the Regent in support
of his own position; the intrigues set on foot against him,
ending in his assassination, and the subsequent train of
events which followed thereon, and which have led to the
overthrow of the Shiogoon’s position and the restoration of
the Emperor to the power originally held in the imperial
hands. The letters may appear to be tedious, but they show
the working of the government more clearly perhaps than a
simple description would do. The country was threatened
with internal disturbance, and there were two parties divided
upon the point of a successor to the Shiogoon, who was
weakly in mind and body—worn out and epileptic. As
leader of the one party was Ee Kamong no kami, the head
of the Fudai Daimios, and having a certain right to be appointed
Regent in case of necessity. He seems to have been
a clever, bold man, to Western ideas unscrupulous in the
means by which he attained his ends. At the head of the
other party was Mito, one of the “three families,” hereditary
vice-Shiogoon in Yedo, and connected by marriage with the
families of the Emperor and the highest Koongays in Miako,
and with the wealthiest Daimios—a shrewd, clever, scheming
old man. What follows must be considered a mere
imperfect sketch of what the pamphlet contains.</p>

<p>The name of the pamphlet is a play upon the name Mito,
meaning Water-door—Midzu Kara Kori. “Water machines
make,” or “A machine made at Mito.” The Regent (whose
name, Ee, means “a well”) wished to take out, as with a
bucket, the water in the well and divide it—<i>i.e.</i>, to break
down the power of Mito.</p>

<p>The pamphlet commences by stating by way of “contents”
that the Regent sent Manabay Simosa no kami to
Miako to seize Takatskasa, the highest officer of the empire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
the Kwanbakku and his son Daifu dono, and Awata, a young
relative of the Emperor, and at the time the head of the
Buddhists—and that these high officers were all put into
confinement, and that all this trouble had its origin at Mito.
The source of the Tokungawa—<i>i.e.</i>, the line of Iyeyas, or
the government by the family of Iyeyas—is very clear, but
this work will show how Mito tried to make it impure. The
book was published in the spring of 1860. The name of the
author is “Every one drunk.”</p>

<p>The anticipated arrival of the United States squadron was
agitating the rulers of Japan, and parties were divided as to
the reception which should be given it. There was probably
some political source of discord besides this, connected more
or less with the office of Shiogoon, which had fallen into the
hands of an epileptic imbecile. It would appear that in 1854
letters were sent to all the Daimios and Ometskis, requiring
them to give their opinions as to the reception which should
be given to the squadron, and whether the Americans should
be repelled by force, or whether a trial should be made of a
limited intercourse with foreigners, under the impression that
if it was not found to work satisfactorily the ports might
again be closed, and the country might return to its old state
of seclusion. The answers sent showed that they were
divided into a large majority for repelling them, by force
of arms if necessary, and a small minority who were for
admitting foreigners to trade. All agreed that it was a
question of peace or war, but many thought that whether
it was to be the one or the other, no answer should be sent
until time was obtained to put the shores and batteries into
a state of defense. At present, they alleged, the coasts were
weak and defenseless, and “if Japan does not conquer it will
be a great disgrace, and the country will be defiled. But,
high and low, all must be unanimous.” In the first place,
it must be ascertained how many men each Daimio can muster,
and the strength of each in guns, ammunition, etc. In
1854, in the tenth month, the Ometskis sent letters to all the
Daimios to obtain information on this head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>In 1855, in the 9th month, the Shiogoon sent a commission
to Mito, ordering him to put all the coasts of the country
into a defensible condition. The care of the forts along the
shore was to be committed to Mito. The forts and guns
were to be examined. The Shiogoon wrote—“You have
hitherto come to me three times every month, now I wish
you to report to me every second day what is doing.”</p>

<p>From published documents, it appears by the Emperor’s
own letter, 22d day of the 2d month, 1858, in corroboration
of what is stated in the pamphlet quoted, “that this matter
was discussed before him by the Kwanbakku (Koozio dono),
the Taiko, or previous Kwanbakku (Takatskasa),<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and the
Tenso. It appears that the old Taiko pleaded as an excuse
that he was unwell, but as the Mikado sent several times to
command his attendance, he was obliged to come. At the
conference the Taiko expressed an opinion contrary to that
of the others, which had been given in favor of the course
advocated by the Shiogoon. The Mikado was very angry”
(with these others), “and it was with difficulty the Kwanbakku
succeeded in pacifying him. On the 23d a document
bearing the refusal of the Mikado to the treaty was written
out. Then three officers went to the residence of Hotta, the
Shiogoon’s first Minister of Foreign Affairs and Envoy to
Miako, to obtain the Mikado’s consent to the American
treaty, and informed him of the document hereunder. The
messengers sent by (to?) the Mikado were afflicted, and shed
tears because they did not succeed.”</p>

<p>The Mikado wrote to the Shiogoon: “23d, 2d mo., 1858.—It
is difficult for us to grant you the approval you ask” (to
the treaties). “For the honor of the name of the first Mikado
it is impossible to agree to it.</p>

<p>“It is our duty to take care to tranquilize the minds of
our people.</p>

<p>“The Shiogoon should gather every one’s opinion, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
the three great houses to the humblest subject, and give me
the result in writing.</p>

<p>“If it is necessary to ... conclude these treaties” (<i>i.e.</i>,
if it is impossible to go back from what has been done),
“exception must be made of the country in the neighborhood
of my imperial city, as we have already directed in our letter,
24th of the 12th month. [The opening of] Hiogo in Sitsu
must be excepted if possible.</p>

<p>“The Mikado often considers that he is not safe in his
palace at Miako, and he directs the Shiogoon to appoint some
powerful Daimios to protect the imperial palace.</p>

<p>“You have thought it well to open the ports to foreigners,
but you did not think that foreigners would entangle you
with difficulties.</p>

<p>“We would know your opinion in this respect.”</p>

<p>This was evidently considered a refusal on the part of the
Emperor to accede to the conclusion of a treaty. There is
not much appearance of what is by a commentator called
“puppetism” in the position of the Emperor when he, standing
here almost alone in his council of bribed and intriguing
officers, who were all in the pay of the Regent at Yedo, still
manfully keeps them all at bay, and, assisted only by his
faithful old minister the Taiko, whose attendance he is
obliged to command, refuses to accede to the course of expediency
pressed upon him by such meanness. He not only
refuses, but he warns them from his lofty position of the pit
which he foresees they are digging for themselves. The
Taiko, probably for his conduct and words at this meeting,
was put by the Regent in confinement in his own house, and
was only released after the fall of this minister.</p>

<p>Then follows a document, a “Circular from the Shiogoon,
the 6th month of 1858, by Kooze yamato no kami.</p>

<p>“The Mikado having been consulted by the Shiogoon’s
government about the making of treaties with foreigners, he
answered that the conclusion of that matter would distress
him very much.</p>

<p>“Thereupon the Shiogoon requested all to send their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
written opinion upon the subject. Only a short time was
required to gather every one’s opinion; but, in the meantime,
some Russian and American men-of-war came here,
bringing the news that in a short time English and French
men-of-war would arrive here; that these two nations had
fought and won many battles in China; that they would
come here in the same warlike spirit, and it would be difficult
for us to negotiate with them. The American embassador
offered to us, that if we would make a temporary
treaty with him, as soon as we should have signed and
given him that treaty he would act as mediator between
us and the French and English, and could save us from
all difficulties.</p>

<p>“It was impossible for us to comply with this without
consultation with the Mikado. However, Inoe Sinano no
kami, fearing the immediate assault (or breaking out of a
war), the results of which might be the same as in China,
signed themselves, as men authorized to sign [this expression
is somewhat suspicious], the American treaty at
Kanagawa, which treaty was given up to the American
embassador.</p>

<p>“Necessity compelled the Japanese to do this.</p>

<p>“The Mikado, on hearing of this, was much troubled, but
to reassure him we told him we would fortify our shores.”</p>

<p>Then further follows a document written by several of
the Koongays in Miako:</p>

<p>“At this time there are great changes taking place in our
holy country in respect to foreigners. However, it is not for
us ignorant people to judge, and for that reason we lately
wrote twice to the Mikado. We hoped that he would consider
the subject.</p>

<p>“We write to him once more. Since the time of Tensio
dai jin the country has been to the present time sublime and
flourishing; but friendship with foreigners will be a stain
upon it, and an insult to the first Mikado (Zinmu). It will
be an everlasting shame for the country to be afraid of those
foreigners, and for us to bear patiently their arbitrary and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
rough manners; and the time will come when we shall be
subservient to them. This is the fault of the dynasty of the
Shiogoon. It is reported that the Shiogoon has sent to Miako
to consult the Mikado about the treaties, but it is impossible
to believe it. Hotta will return to Yedo and say that the
Mikado has consented to give him a secret authorization,
and he will thus induce the other Daimios to follow the
party of the Shiogoon. The Shiogoon thus disturbs peace.
If foreigners come to our country they will loudly proclaim
the mutual benefits that trade will produce, but at home
they will think only of vile profit; and when we shall refuse
to comply with all their wishes, they will threaten us
with their artillery and men-of-war. They intend to take
Japan, and to effect this will resort to any kind of deep
scheme in their negotiations. It is earnestly wished that
the Mikado order that the Daimios from the ‘three families’
to the lowest give their vote upon the subject.” The
Daimios gave their vote, and they were generally in favor
of exclusion of foreign nations, and of adhering to their
old way.</p>

<p>In 1857, on the 28th day of the 12th month, Hino came
to Yedo from Miako, as bearer of a letter from the Emperor
addressed to the Shiogoon.</p>

<p>“Your duty is to act as Shiogoon; and yet you, being Se
i dai Shiogoon [barbarian-quelling commander-in-chief], are
unable to perform your duties. You ought to know what
the duties of that office are, and yet our foreign enemies
(eeteki) you are unable to punish. You have many high
officers with you, and this matter is one of the utmost importance;
therefore I wish you to come as soon as you can
to Miako. If you are unable to come on account of the business
of the empire, then you must dispatch some able and
experienced officers, that I may hear myself what is doing.
At the present moment all Daimio, Shomio and Shonin (people)
are in perplexity. Why is this? It is because the business
of the Shiogoon office does not go straight. On this
account I have every day great trouble, and therefore I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
have commanded Koojio Kwanbakku to send Hino, and to
communicate orally with you.”</p>

<p>(This letter is supposed by some not to have been written
by the Emperor, but to have been a forgery by the Koku
shiu and higher Daimios.)</p>

<p>Mito, in 1855, had been very active and serviceable in
telling the other Daimios that it was all very well to talk
of fighting, but that they must first know what means they
had. He had been appointed to look after the defenses of
the empire. It may be presumed that the more powerful
of the opposite party were annoyed with his obtaining this
appointment, and with showing them their weaknesses, and
had cabaled against him under the headship of Ee Kamong
no kami.</p>

<p>On the 29th day of the 12th month of 1857, the letter
was given by Hino to the Shiogoon; and the same night a
meeting of all Daimios was held in the Siro jo in, a large
hall in the castle of Yedo. The deliberations were not over
till two o’clock in the morning of the 30th.</p>

<p>In 1858, on the 23d day of the 4th month, Ee Kamong no
kami was appointed Regent (Gotairo). He was a Sho sho
or major-general, and had been brought up while a boy as
a Buddhist priest. Probably by this time the Shiogoon was
become quite imbecile, and it became necessary to appoint a
regent. Ee, being of an age and capacity fit for the situation,
had the first claim. He seems to have all along taken
a course opposed to Mito, probably arising out of attempts
to obtain this office; and as Mito was strenuously opposed to
the admission of foreigners, Ee took the opposite side, and
declared for the new state of things.</p>

<p>On the 6th day of the 7th month a communication was
made to Owarri, the first of the “three families,” to the
effect that “the Shiogoon regrets to have to notice the conduct
of Owarri, and that he cannot longer hold friendly
communication with him. It is the will of the Shiogoon
that Owarri in future shall confine himself to his house at
Toyama in Yedo, and abstain from official business, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
that he shall not speak to any one. That, further, all his
territories shall be confiscated, and they are handed over
to his relative, Matzdaira Setsu no kami,” who was then
a child.</p>

<p>To Mito a somewhat similar communication was made,
and ordering him to confine himself in his house at Koma
(ngome near Oji).</p>

<p>These commands, dictated by the Regent, were forthwith
carried into execution. The smaller Ometski were appointed
to see that such sentences were carried out. One result was
that a great number of the poorer retainers of these chiefs
were thrown on the country as “floating men,” or Ronins,
with their two swords to gain themselves a livelihood.</p>

<p>To Hongo Tango no kami, member of the Wakatoshi
yori, a similar letter was sent, and he was deprived of the
half of his territory and confined to his house.</p>

<p>In addition to these, Ishikawa Tosa no kami was fined
the half of his territory, and a doctor to the Shiogoon, Hoka
Riki, was turned out of his office and all his property taken
from him. But his son was presented with 250 piculs of
rice per annum, as he had shown himself on the side of the
Regent.</p>

<p>(There is no mention in this work of similar treatment
being shown to the great lords, Satsuma, Tosa and Etsizen.)</p>

<p>On the 8th day of the 8th month, the name of Harutaka,
son of Kii dainagoon, was changed to Iyay mutchi. This is
the boy whom the Regent and his party had put into the
place of power, the Shiogoon having been dead for some
time. It was given out that he was unwell, and the Regent
had been taking means to strengthen his position against
Mito. Mito claimed the place for his own son, who had
been adopted by Stotsbashi, who was the third son of the
ninth Shiogoon. The youth who succeeded was the nearest
heir, according to European ideas; and Mito’s claim had the
defect, that if adoption carried the full consequences which
he wished it should, it militated against himself.</p>

<p>The 9th day of the 9th month was the day chosen for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
nominal death of the Shiogoon. Ee Kamong no kami was
much with the late Shiogoon before his death, and gave out
that he had ordered him to act as Regent during the young
man’s minority.</p>

<p>Manabay Simosa no kami, one of the Cabinet, was sent
by the Regent to carry out his schemes in Miako. He returned
in the 12th month, and a few days after his return
abdicated his honors and his territory.</p>

<p>Hotta, who had acted as envoy from the Regent to Miako,
was degraded. On the 26th day of the 11th month, the two
highest officers, Koo jio dono the Kwanbakku, and Ni jio
dono Nai dai jin, came to Yedo as envoys from the Emperor.</p>

<p>On the 1st day of the 12th month the title of “Se i dai
Shiogoon” was conferred on Se i sho sama Iyaymutchi by
the Emperor, by the hands of two chokushi or envoys. The
Empress also sent an envoy to the Shiogoon to compliment
him upon his obtaining the title, and perhaps also to lay the
first proposal as to his marrying the Emperor’s younger
sister Kadsumia.</p>

<p>During the 12th month, Manabay went down to Miako
with orders to Ishigaya Inaba no kami, one of the governors
of Miako, to seize the following persons: Ee kai kitchi,
the gentleman in charge of Mito’s house in Miako, and his
son; three gentlemen, retainers in the service of the Kwanbakku
Takatskasa dono, and the son of one of them, and a
teacher of Chinese in Miako; Matzdaira Tanba no kami, a
Daimio, related by marriage to Satsuma. His territory was
taken from him and given to a child (Matzdaira Toki no
skay). This child’s followers were, after the Regent’s death,
put in charge of the British Legation at Tozenji; also a retainer
of this Daimio and his secretary. These were all
seized by order of the Regent, and sent to Yedo for trial
before the Jeesha boonyo, the judges in the Hio jo sho.</p>

<p>In the 1st month of the following year—<i>i.e.</i>, about March,
1859—several of the gentlemen about the court in the service
of the members of the imperial family and others of very
high rank were arrested. Three of these were retainers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
Sanjio dono, of Arisungawa mia, and of Saiwonji dono respectively.
Two retainers of the nephew of the Emperor,
the Buddhist high-priest and the secretary of the Kwanbakku,
were ordered to be sent up to Yedo. Within two
months after this, seven high Koongays and four ladies,
with seventeen more of the persons about the court, were
all sent to Yedo by orders of Ee Kamong no kami.</p>

<p>In 1859, on the 2d day, 2d month, Itakura Suwo no
kami, one of the Jeesha boonyo (temple lords acting as
judges) was degraded. His crime was, that, being judge
in rotation in the Hio jo sho in Yedo when these prisoners
were brought before him, he would not bring them in guilty
of anything, as he did not fear the Regent, and he had been
requested secretly by the Emperor not to gratify him. At
the same time Tsuchiya, governor of Osaka, was degraded
and removed. He was an illegitimate son of Mito.</p>

<p>In the year 1858, before these strong measures had been
taken by the Regent, Mito had written to the Emperor in the
8th month to the following effect: “Your revenue is not
large enough, which is the cause of much sorrow to me.
Permit me to present you with a few kobangs; and if it is
in your power, please give to the Kwanbakku Koozio dono
some additional land, and all the Koongays and those about
the court who have titles [I give?] 20,000 kobangs among
them; and as Hirohashi is very diligent and able, I present
him with silver.”</p>

<p>It may be presumed that with the system of espionage so
perfected as it is in Japan, the Regent would soon find out
that Mito was intriguing at Miako, and probably got a copy
of this letter before he gave orders to seize the persons above
named, who were all implicated in these intrigues against
him.</p>

<p>In the year 1858, in the 8th month, the Shiogoon (or the
Regent more truly) sent three Daimios as envoys to Mito,
with a letter to the following effect:</p>

<p>“You, Mito, formerly were anxious to assist Japan in her
troubles, and your reasons for so doing were very good. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
the Shiogoon does not approve of your recent conduct.”
(Mito had written to the Emperor, with whom he was connected
by marriage, to complain of the boy from the Kii
family having been made Shiogoon, on the ground of his
being too young for the office, but in reality to get his own
son appointed by the Emperor to the place.) “You have
spoken to the Emperor too much about the adopted son of
Kii. Further, you have sent letters to the Koongays and
members of the imperial family to gain them over to your
views; and you, a man of rank, have not scrupled to use
low men [Ronins] to carry letters to Miako, inveighing
against the government of Yedo. From these acts of yours
great confusion has arisen. The Emperor has written a letter
to the Shiogoon, and low men have been used as the
bearers [? to insult the Yedo government]. You have tried
to stir up a quarrel between the Emperor and the Kubosama,
and have excited discord among the Koongays. It is a most
improper thing for you thus to be acting behind our back,
and in the dark.” (Mito had sent many letters to the Fudai
Daimios and Yakonins to gain them over to the side of Stotsbashi.)
“You must suffer a severe punishment. But as it
is now the time of Hoji” (<i>i.e.</i>, the canonization of the late
Shiogoon), “we are willing to view your crime with leniency.
Your punishment is, that you be henceforth imprisoned
in your room [cheekio]. This letter I intrust to the
care of your son, to be delivered to you.”</p>

<p>At the same time a letter was sent to Mito’s son and
heir, of tenor as follows:</p>

<p>“Your father has been carrying on secret intrigues at
Miako. He has sent many of his servants there upon highly
important missions. But all his intrigues have been against
the Shiogoon secretly, and, as it were, behind his back. The
ways of father and son” (<i>i.e.</i>, the son cannot help what his
father does) “are different, but I think you may follow a
better way than your father. If you have no better way,
you must send guards to keep your father, and prevent
his carrying on these intrigues. The crime of putting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
himself in opposition to the Shiogoon is very great, and
merits severe punishment. But you side with your father,
and it is natural for you to do so from filial obedience. But
for this crime your father must be removed from his position
and territory.”</p>

<p>On the 27th day of the 8th month a letter was sent to the
principal one of the retainers, the Karo, or minister of Mito.
“Your master has been engaged in very dangerous schemes
and intrigues, of which you were ignorant.” (Mito had
written a letter to say that all the Daimios gave themselves
up to trifling and debauchery.) “You were very foolish if
you did not know of this business, and you ought on that
account to be severely punished. But as Mito, your master,
said that this business in which he was engaged was entirely
for the good of the empire of Japan, and of the greatest consequence,
your punishment shall be mitigated. In future
you will take care to look into what your master is doing,
and not cause the government of the Shiogoon so much
trouble.</p>

<p>“In future, if you do cause trouble, you shall be severely
punished.”</p>

<p>It appeared that both parties were trying to gain over the
Kwanbakku by bribes—the Regent on the one hand, and
Mito on the other. This high officer was perplexed which
to side with, but he concealed all from the Emperor.</p>

<p>The Shiogoon commanded a letter to be written to Mito,
to inform him that government was aware that many men
had come secretly to Yedo from Mito, and warning him of
what would be the consequence if any trouble should arise;
and at the same time eight Daimios were appointed to guard
the approaches to the city.</p>

<p>At this time the Regent was maturing his plans, and
having arrested many of the agents of Mito, brought them
before the Hio jo sho and judges of Yedo. The personal
enmity of the two was working for the opening up of the
country to foreign trade.</p>

<p>Many persons, some of whom were connected with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
highest officers in Miako and Yedo, were arrested as being
engaged with Mito in intrigues. The head retainer of Mito
was kept in confinement, and was commanded to kill himself
in prison:<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Eekai, the gentleman in charge of Mito’s
house in Miako, with his third son, the head chamberlain of
Mito’s establishment, the gentleman in the service of the late
Kwanbakku, the Chinese teacher, and a lady about the establishment
of Konoyay dono, in Miako, were brought before
the judges in the Hio jio sho Hoki no kami, and the two
city magistrates, Ishingaya and Ikeda.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Of the prisoners, the
first three were beheaded.</p>

<p>On the 8th month, 20th day, the following letter was sent
to Nakayama Bizen no kami, who was a Hattamoto in the
service of government, resident at Mito’s castle to assist him
(or to watch him). Officers with the same duties reside at
the castles of the other two Sankay, Owarri and Kii:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>“Your house is a very honorable one, and you are a man
of talent and experience. You ought to attend more correctly
to do your duty. Now you have been neglecting
your duty, while Mito the elder has been intriguing at Miako
against me. You are ignorant of what is going on, and
show yourself to be very indolent. This is a harsh mode of
speaking, but you are still very young. You are hereby
ordered to consider yourself under arrest, and remain a
prisoner in your own room.”</p>

<p>Toki, a colonel of the Household Guards, was degraded
from his rank, and his territory confiscated.</p>

<p>To the Sakuji boonyo, Iwase, and to the First Lord of
the Admiralty, Nangai, it was ordered that their salaries
were to be stopped from that date.</p>

<p>The same punishment was inflicted upon Kawadsi, the
keeper of the West Castle. To the Kosho, his eldest grandson,
it was written:</p>

<p>“Your grandfather has been guilty of opposing the government,
and has been degraded and deprived of his territory,
and ordered to confine himself to his room. Therefore
it is our will that you take possession of his territory, and
also of his office.”</p>

<p>It seems to have been the Regent’s policy always to put
children in place of those men whom he displaced.</p>

<p>The other keeper of the West Castle was degraded, and
deprived both of his territory and office.</p>

<p>To Tayki no skay, commander of the vanguard of the
army, son of Oodo, it was written: “Having examined into
the offense of your father, I have degraded him; but you
are his adopted son, and therefore I give to you his territory
and house.”</p>

<p>Of other high officers some were beheaded, while others
were ordered not to enter a town (Chu tsui ho); others were
imprisoned in their own houses (Oshi kome), or in prison;
others were put in irons; others confined to one room for life
(ay chikio); others were banished to small islands.</p>

<p>All the above, who were themselves persons of some rank,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
and connected with the highest in the empire, were brought
to the Hio jo sho, in Yedo, and received their sentences from
the temple lords sitting there.</p>

<p>To Hongo Tango no kami, at that time in the Lower
Cabinet, the Shiogoon wrote:</p>

<p>“Your conduct recently has been very improper. The
Shiogoon has heard of this, and you deserve to be severely
punished; but I will be lenient, and only deprive you of
5,000 koku of revenue, and degrade you.” (He had been
made a Daimio, with 10,000 koku of revenue, by the previous
Shiogoon.) To his son the Shiogoon wrote as above, but
added: “I will now take the ground I took from your father,
reducing him from a Daimio to a Hattamoto. Your father
must stay in his house, and retire from public life, and give
over his lands and rank to you.”</p>

<p>To Ishikawa Tosa no kami a similar letter was written,
depriving him of his honors and territory, which were given
to his son.</p>

<p>The head of the Treasury, Sassaki Sinano no kami, was
degraded.</p>

<p>Iyo no ske, a gentleman in the service of Mito, was
transported to Hatchi jio. His son, being only three
years of age, is to be kept till he is fifteen, and then
transported also.</p>

<p>Two boys, aged four and two years, sons of Mito’s chamberlain,
are to be expelled from towns when they arrive at
fifteen years of age.</p>

<p>The Regent, after thus disposing of his enemies, proceeded,
in the name of the Shiogoon, to reward his friends.</p>

<p>He wrote to Matzdaira Idzumi no kami, then the head
of the Cabinet: “I approve of what you have done, and in
testimony I give you twenty-five obangs. [An obang is a
large gold coin worth about thirty-five dollars.] You have
been very diligent in a most difficult and important business.
I am very much satisfied, and will change your territory;
and as that you now possess is very poor, I will give you
better.” (He also sent him a sword.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>To the temple lord, Matzdaira Hoki no kami, were given
a saddle and six dresses.</p>

<p>To the Owo metski Kowongai were given seven obangs
and four dresses.</p>

<p>To the street governor of Yedo, Ikeda, were given seven
obangs and five dresses.</p>

<p>To the second street governor, Ishi ngaya, ten obangs
and five dresses.</p>

<p>To the treasurer, five obangs and three dresses.</p>

<p>These men had acted as the judges in the Hio jo sho, and
had awarded the punishments to the accused. Itakura was
degraded because he would not act as the tool of the Regent
in executing his vengeance.</p>

<p>In a letter to these officers the Shiogoon expresses satisfaction
with the diligence shown by them, and on that account
rewards them, at the same time rewarding smaller
officers who have been similarly engaged, but without specifying
them by name.</p>

<p>To Manabay, who had been formerly Prime Minister,
and lately much engaged in ferreting out these intrigues
for the Regent, the Shiogoon wrote: “You are now not very
strong, and it will be perhaps better that you retire from the
weight of public duty.”</p>

<p>The Regent and he had a difference as to whether he was
right in, or had the power of, punishing these men. The
Regent was anxious to get rid of him, but his arguments
were strong, and, besides, he was cognizant of all the secrets
of the late <i>coup d’etat</i>, so that the Regent dared not take a
stronger step than simply advise him to withdraw.</p>

<p>The Regent must have been well aware that in acting
as he was doing he was playing a dangerous game. He had
not been afraid to enter the family of the Emperor himself.
The servants of the highest Koongays had been arrested,
and themselves insulted and degraded. He had degraded
five of the highest Daimios—Owarri, Mito, Satsuma, Tosa,
and Etsizen—and had severely punished all of lower rank
who had in any way countenanced or assisted those opposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
to him. He had put his own protégé on the seat of the
Shiogoon, in opposition to Stotsbashi, the nominee of Mito.
He now felt that he must retain the reins of power in his
own hands, as, if he yielded a jot, his enemies would overthrow
him, and take away his place and name. The only
thing he had now to fear was secret enemies, who might
wreak their vengeance by poison or assassination.</p>

<p>The 3d day of the 3d month is a day when a great levee
is held at the castle in Yedo, all the Daimios on duty appearing
in court dresses, with large retinues. At such times it
is common for strangers to gather on the broad road or
esplanade by the side of the castle moat, to watch the trains
of the Daimios going to and returning from court. They
often carry with them the small monthly list of officials in
which the armorial bearings are given, by which the train
of each Daimio may be at once recognized. In the Daimios’
quarter of the city the guards of the streets and cross streets
are the retainers of Daimios. The guard-houses are sometimes
divided into two when the guard is divided between
two neighboring Daimios. Upon days of levee such as this
strangers are allowed to loiter about, and are not so readily
noticed as at other times.</p>

<p>At the south side of the castle of Yedo is the Soto Sakurada,
or outer Cherry gate, opening from that part of the inclosure
in which the residences of the Gorochiu are situated.
At this gate the moat is crossed by a bridge which opens
upon a wide graveled road—the Tatsu no kutchi—bounded
on the one side by the moat, on the other by Daimios’ residences,
and leading by a gentle ascent to the residence of
the Regent, Ee Kamong no kami.</p>

<p>On the 3d day of the 3d month the Shiogoon was to hold
this levee, at which the Regent, now that he had put down
his enemies, would appear in the plenitude of his power as
the real ruler of Japan. He set out in his norimono toward
the Sakurada gate, which was at a short distance, and seen
from the door of his own residence. He was surrounded by
his own retinue in white dresses. Suddenly a rush of men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
was made at the train. The bearers set down the norimono.
Men with drawn swords ordered him to come out. He expostulated.
One fired a pistol through the chair, wounding
him in the back. He tried to crawl out, but his head was
immediately cut off and carried away by the assassins.</p>

<p>The investigation which follows will show what took
place.</p>

<p>On the 3d day of the 3d month (March 24, 1860) the
Gorochiu wrote to the commander of the guard kept by
Matzdaira Segami no kami: “Why did you allow men in
disguise, with small sleeves and drawn swords, to pass your
guard and loiter about the Tatsu no kutchi?” To this a
reply was given: “There was a heavy fall of snow at the
time. I noticed the men once, and they disappeared; but I
acknowledge my fault—I am much to blame in the matter.
But what shall I do now? Shall I cut off my men’s heads?”</p>

<p>The same question was put to Matzdaira Daizen no daibu’s
(Choshiu) guard, who kept the Sakurada gate. He
answered: “This morning at nine o’clock many men passed,
but whether they were porters or soldiers I cannot tell.
Several passed with blood-stained swords in their hands.
I was on the point of arresting them, but as there was much
snow falling I could not see them distinctly, or where they
went to.”</p>

<p>The principal gentleman in the late Regent’s service,
Kimatta Watari, wrote to the Gorochiu as follows: “This
morning, while my master was on his way to the shiro to
pay his respects to the Shiogoon, an attack was made upon
his train. In the scuffle one man was killed, and the servants
of Ee brought the body to the house here.”</p>

<p>It is a general impression in Yedo that the servants, or
some of them, as well as the guards about, and even some
of the Daimios living in the neighborhood, were cognizant
of the attack about to be made. Some of them gave no
assistance to their master.</p>

<p>The same day the Shiogoon sent two Katchi metsuki to
Ee Kamong no kami’s house to make inquiries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>The servants of Sakkai oota no kami, guards of the Owo
tay, a large gate of the castle, wrote a similar letter to the
above. It is a common plan in Japan, even among Daimios,
when an investigation is to be made in which many are concerned,
for all to write similar letters, to prevent the government
seizing one. They added: “One Ronin, between
twenty-seven and twenty-eight years of age, cut his throat.
He only had his sword-sheath when found, and no sword.
We found one wounded by a shot, and seized him.”</p>

<p>At Tatsu no kutchi, the men at the cross-street guard-house,
occupied by Tajima no kami and Sakkai oota no
kami, said to the Gorochiu: “At about eight o’clock this
morning a man shot himself through the neck while holding
a man’s head in his hand. Immediately one of the guard
said, ‘I will ask the man where he came from.’ He said he
was a servant of Satsuma. We sent for a surgeon, and
he is now under treatment.”</p>

<p>Ee Kamong no kami writes himself to the Shiogoon (notwithstanding
his having had his head removed several hours
previous): “I proposed going to the levee at the palace, and
was on my way there, when near the Sakurada gate, and
in front of the joint guard of Matzdaira Osumi no kami
and Ooyay Soongi, about twenty men were collected. They
began to fire pistols, and afterward with swords attacked me
in my norimono. My servants thereupon resisted, and killed
one of the men—the others ran off and escaped. I having
received several wounds, could not pay my intended visit to
the Shiogoon, and was obliged to return to my house, and
now I send the names of such of my servants as were
wounded.”</p>

<p>Of these there were in all nineteen, of which number
several died.</p>

<p>Upon receiving intelligence of this attack, the Shiogoon
sent to the Regent a present of ginseng root, and to inquire
more particularly as to his health and condition.</p>

<p>Upon the coats which were left by the assassins pieces of
poetry had been worked with the needle; such as, “Let us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
take and hoist the silken standard of Japan, and first go and
fight the battles of the Emperor.” Upon another was the
following: “My corpse may dry up with the flowers of the
cherry, but how can the spirit of Japan relax?”</p>

<p>The names of eighteen men are given who were engaged
in the assassination of the Regent. Of these—</p>

<p>Arimura Jesayay mong, who is said to have been the
actual perpetrator of the deed, was head servant of Satsuma.—His
brother is probably the man who assassinated
Mr. Richardson in 1862.</p>

<p>Sanno take no ske, a servant of Mito.</p>

<p>Seito Kemmootz.</p>

<p>These three, with two others, are said to have died of the
wounds received, on the 7th day of the 3d month, or four
days after his death. Sakkai and Yakushuri, on the part of
the Shiogoon, sent a letter to Ee Kamong no kami, to ask
how he was, and to bestow upon him a present of fish and
sugar, as a mark of regard.</p>

<p>The Cabinet was in difficulty how to act. They were of
the party of the Regent, but were now afraid that the opposite
views would prevail, and that power would fall into the
hands of Mito.</p>

<p>On the part of the Gorochiu, Neito Kii no kami wrote to
the servants of Ee Kamong no kami:</p>

<p>“As a severe misfortune has befallen Ee Kamong no
kami, all his servants and relations are liable to be implicated
in the trouble.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> If you, in revenge, should raise disturbance
with the followers of Mito, it will occasion much trouble.
I will endeavor to arrange matters for you, and keep things
quiet.”</p>

<p>For some time after the assassination, the gates of the
Shiogoon’s castle, known as the Sakurada, Babasaki, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
Watakura, were shut. The Tayass gate at Take bashi, the
Hanzo and Saymidzu gates, were open during the day and
shut at night.</p>

<p>The members of the Cabinet were allowed a guard of
sixty men, and those of the lower Cabinet fifty men.</p>

<p>The men now feared by the government, the partisans of
Mito, were lurking about Yedo in numbers. It was known
that the head of the Regent had been carried off to the city
of Mito and put up on a pole, with much abusive writing
attached to it.</p>

<p>The Shiogoon gave orders to five Daimios to arrest all
suspicious persons from Mito, and to seize the leaders of the
movement.</p>

<p>Mito had said, tauntingly, “How can I, a poor Daimio,
arrest these men, when you, the Shiogoon, are not able to do
so? If you wish to seize these men, send your officers and
do it. From Tatsuno kootchi a head was brought, and Ee
Kamong no kami’s servants are very anxious to get possession
of it.”</p>

<p>The head of the Cabinet, Neito, wrote to Matzdaira
Osumi no kami: “Three days ago a high officer was assassinated
before your door. You did not go to his assistance,
or prevent the outrage. You were very negligent of your
duty, and you are to be punished by the door of your residence
being shut for one week, and you are not to go out
during that time, but to confine yourself to your own house.”</p>

<p>A similar message was sent to Katagiri Iwami no kami,
keeper of the Heebiyah gate; and also to Toda stchi no ske
(a child), keeper of the Babasaki gate.</p>

<p>At this time the streets of Yedo were placarded with
squibs against the party of the late Regent and those in
favor of foreigners. One of these accused the late Gotairo
of enriching himself by foreign trade at the expense of the
people of Japan, and others were obscure allusions to the
founder of the family. Another, by turning the characters
of his name upside down, makes of it, “A gentleman’s head
swept away is very good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>(Some of these squibs were what is called “Yabatai”
writing. This name is founded on the following: Abe no
naka maro in old times was sent as embassador to China.
The Chinese Emperor was angry with him, and said that
if he could not read a certain piece of writing he would
kill him. He failed, and was put to death. Another embassador
succeeded, to whom the same alternative was
given. While he was musing upon it, and praying to Ten
sho go dai jin, a spider dropped from the ceiling upon the
paper, and went from word to word showing him how it was
to be read. This is called Yabatai, wild-horse writing, now
converted into Yaotai, wild-fool writing.)</p>

<p>The following information as to the assassins appears to
have been given to the Gorochiu by Hossokawa, the Daimio
to whose residence several of the assassins fled, saying that
they were men from Mito, and wished to place themselves
under his protection. He is supposed to have known all
about the affair from the first.</p>

<p>One of the assassins, Mori, said that, about three months
before, he had attempted to kill the Regent by shooting him
with a pistol. The ball passed through the norimono, and
he made his escape. The day they came to Hossokawa’s
house was very cold, so they were provided with food and
wine. There was much snow falling, which furthered the
designs of the assassins, as they thought it was assistance
given them from heaven. They were all very tired and
sleepy. Upon the 18th day of the 2d month they all went
to Mito, afterward returning to Yedo; and they met in the
morning of the 3d day of the 3d month at Atango yama.
They did not sleep there; but the Buddhist priest was cognizant
of what was going on.</p>

<p>The government in Yedo had doubtless good cause for
alarm at the present crisis, as Mito, on the one hand, and
the young Ee, son of the Regent, on the other, were making
preparations for a fight. The policy of Iyeyas in compelling
the lords to be personally in Yedo with few followers, while
their strength in men remained at their provincial seats, prevented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
any outbreak. Mito was gradually filling his houses
in Yedo with men.</p>

<p>On the other side, the family retainers of the Ee Kamong
no kami, the lad who had succeeded to his father, fearing
what might be the result of the present crisis, brought up ten
cannon from his shta yashiki in the suburbs of Yedo, to his
kami yashiki. [Every Daimio of any wealth has three houses
in Yedo: his own residence, kami yashiki, where his wife
and family reside, near the castle; naka yashiki, where concubines,
servants, etc., reside; and shta yashiki, where he
has a garden, and retainers, servants, and their families
reside.] From his lands at Sano, in the province of Simotsuki,
he brought up 400 men.</p>

<p>On the same day on which the Regent was killed, an
attempt was made by Ronins of Mito to kill Matzdaira
Sanuki no kami, who was a near relative of Mito, but a
friend and son-in-law of Ee Kamong no kami. He had
some suspicion, and was unwell on the day of the levee, and
sent his son in his place. The norimono was attacked, but
when the son was dragged out, and they discovered their
mistake, the assassins let him go. The father did not long
escape, however. He had taken as a concubine a girl from
Mito, who, during the next month, stabbed him while in
bed, and cut off his head, sending it to Mito. Matzdaira
Koonai no tayu, another friend of the Regent’s, and also a
relative of Mito, hearing in the palace of the murder of the
Regent, escaped by a back way.</p>

<p>The Daimio Hossokawa Etshiu no kami wrote to the
government as follows:</p>

<p>“Yesterday morning some men came to my guards at
the main gate, and said they were servants of Mito and had
killed the Regent, and it was right that they should go to
the Gorochiu; but as it is the first time they have come
to Yedo, and do not know where the Gorochiu live, they
requested me to go with them. I asked them who they
were and what they wanted. They answered, that they had
been this morning fighting with the Regent at the Sakurada<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
gate; and having first wounded him with a pistol, they
pulled him by the right hand out of the kango and cut off
his head. There came at first only nine men, but these were
followed by a number of others: whence they came I do not
know.”</p>

<p>Hossokawa accompanied these men to the Hio jo sho,
where the judges on duty asked them to give in writing their
reasons for killing the Regent. The answer was: “We have
good reasons. From the time of Zin mu tenwo to the present
day the Japanese nation has never received any insult
from a foreign nation; now five foreign nations have made
treaties, and all through the empire the people are angry
and sorry and vexed, and the Regent did not care. If he
does not care for this, he makes himself an enemy to the
nation, and therefore we killed him. We have no other
reason.”</p>

<p>The officers at the Hio jo sho were afraid to ask any more
questions.</p>

<p>Mito sent the following letter to the Shiogoon:</p>

<p>“I am told that some men who were formerly in my service,
but who were dismissed, have gone this morning to the
Sakurada gate and killed Ee Kamong no kami. They appear
to have gone to Hossokawa, wishing that he should
take them into his employ. A messenger from Hossokawa
has brought me this information. I am very sorry for it, and
it has caused me much distress. I could not employ so many
servants, and therefore was obliged to reduce my establishment,
while some men who would not obey me went away
of their own accord. On this account I am unable to arrest
or punish such men, and must trust to the servants of the
Shiogoon doing so, while I must try to find those who have
absconded; but the Shiogoon is powerful while I am comparatively
powerless; I therefore beg the assistance of the
Shiogoon.”</p>

<p>The Shiogoon wrote to Mito on the 4th day of the 3d
month:</p>

<p>“Yesterday your servants killed the Gotairo, and now I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
fear they may attack and kill some of the Gorochiu. It is
ordered that your servants from morning to night, all day
and all night, are not to move out of the house.”</p>

<p>Otta, Hiobu sho, wrote to the Shiogoon:</p>

<p>“This morning about 8 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the men of my guard informed
me that two soldiers had passed them wounded and
covered with blood. They, when very near my cross guard,
committed suicide. I thereupon sent an Ometski to investigate
the case. I asked the men standing near whence they
had come. They said from the direction of the Heebiyah
gate, and that on account of a severe wound of the shoulder
one of them was faint and could not walk. He said to his
companion, ‘I cannot kill myself, as I cannot move my right
hand’; the other said, ‘If you are weak I will do it for you,’
and cut off his head, and immediately after doing so he cut
his own throat. We found that one of the swords of these
men was bent round like a bow, and on examining the pockets,
one had seven boos [coins], and the other seven boos and
a half; and besides the money was a crest similar to that
used by the Shiogoon [Mito uses the same crest—the awoyee,
or three leaves], which had been cut from his coat; and a
receipt from the Yebi ya [<i>i.e.</i>, lobster inn], a tea-house at
the Yosiwarra [the government brothel]—viz., two boos for
Tamanyoshi and two for Chittosay, two girls; one boo for
a singing-girl; one boo for drink, two boos for fish, and ten
tenpos for rice, with half a boo as a present to the servants
of the house, with the date, 2d month, 27th day.”</p>

<p>The street governor came and examined the corpses, and
took them away on the 4th day of the 3d month.</p>

<p>On the 4th day of the 3d month—<i>i.e.</i>, the day after the
assassination—Satsuma wrote to the Shiogoon:</p>

<p>“A servant of mine, Arimura Yooske, yesterday absconded
and has not yet returned. I find that a man who
committed suicide yesterday, near the residence of Endo
Tajima no kami, was his elder brother. As I am ignorant
of what he has been doing, please to order him to be
arrested.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>On the 3d day of the 3d month the Ronins in the service
of Mito who had assisted in the murder wrote out the following
statement and gave it to Hossokawa:</p>

<p>“We left our province of Hitatsi on the 18th day of last
month; we did not meet together, but stopped at different
parts of the town during our stay in Yedo. This morning
we all met at the temple on Atango Hill [in the middle of
Yedo], and thence we went to the Cherry gate, and waited
between the guard-house of Osumi no kami and the Cherry
gate. The Gotairo came along with his retinue. All at
once we surrounded the kango on both sides. For some
time we argued with the Gotairo. We told him that he was
a bad man. We spoke to him about foreigners coming to
the country, about the export of gold, about his receiving
money as bribes from foreigners. He answered, and his
men tried to prevent any attack being made upon him.
One of our men fired a pistol into the kango (by which shot
he was wounded in the back). He crawled out of the kango,
but could not rise off his hands and knees quickly. His
servants ran away, and one man cut off his head; six or
seven others hacked at his body.”</p>

<p>In the pocket of Arimura, the servant of Satsuma, who
had been killed, was found a “sakiburay,” or permit to
travel for the Prince of Satsuma, who was at this time a
child—“My master to-morrow sets out for Satsuma, and
wants at each station coolies and horses.” There was also
found a piece of poetry:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“This is my body, which belongs to my master;</div>
<div class="verse">I will wait in the ground till my name is made greater.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The following is given as information with reference
apparently to the men who had banded themselves together
to free their country from the presence of foreigners:</p>

<p>“There are sixty honorable men in the service of Mito
who are very hard and iron-willed. Why are they so iron-willed?
To drive away foreigners according to the wish of
the Emperor expressed in his letter of the 28th day of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
12th month. Mito has received a letter from the Emperor.
Hikonay [<i>i.e.</i>, the Regent, from the name of his castle] gave
it to him to tell him he must go to Miako. We have got the
Emperor’s letter and know his wishes [that foreigners should
be driven out of Japan], and if we do not obey him we are
rebels. The will of the Emperor we are determined to
accomplish.”</p>

<p>As further information the following is given: Hotta
Bitshiu no kami went to Miako on the part of the Gotairo to
speak to the Emperor about the foreign treaties with Japan.
The Emperor said to him: “You have made your treaties
first, and afterward come to me to tell me of what you have
done. I know nothing about it. I know nothing about the
business transacted in Kwanto—<i>i.e.</i>, in Yedo.” Hotta could
not answer the Emperor.</p>

<p>The Regent then sent Manabay to Miako to speak to the
Emperor. He had an audience of the Emperor, and advised
him to wipe out the treaty made at Yedo, and to make an
entirely new and proper one. The Emperor replied: “You
have fouled my face, and consider me as of no use. From
the beginning there was always an Emperor in Japan; but
if now the people do not wish it, I will give up my position.
But you are trying to sow divisions between the Emperor
and the Shiogoon.”</p>

<p>Manabay said: “It will be better for us to make their
interests one [alluding to the proposal that the Shiogoon
should marry the sister of the Emperor]. If we do so, we
can afterward unite to brush out foreigners.”</p>

<p>The Emperor replied: “Now, at three or four audiences
you have brought forward the business of Kwanto, but each
time it has been false. Now you speak truth. If you think
it right, put out these foreigners now. But my honor has
been fouled and broken.”</p>

<p>Manabay said: “At present the government of Japan is
difficult and in a critical position, but let us be quiet and
delay.”</p>

<p>Manabay had, for the Regent, given large sums of money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
to the high Koongays, the Kwanbakku, and others, to bring
over the Emperor to his side. The Emperor was then standing
alone, the Kwanbakku having been bought over. Manabay,
on his return, retired from the Gorochiu to his provincial
residence in Etsizen, but he got the credit of having
saved Japan at this critical period from a civil war. It was
only postponed for a little.</p>

<p>The Gorochiu were in great alarm at this time, and issued
orders to all the guards around and in Yedo to be on the
watch for disturbances.</p>

<p>At the Hio jo sho the following evidence was elicited
from one of the guards:</p>

<p>“I am a Gay zammi.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> In the open space in front of the
gate there were eight or nine men standing—some with raincoats
on, and some holding umbrellas—and looking at the
Sode bookang.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> I heard a pistol-shot in the open space in
front, and several shots were fired at the kango. The bearers
ran away. Some men then seized Ee Kamong no kami
by the mangay [<i>i.e.</i>, the stiff tuft of hair on the top of the
head], and dragged him out of the kango. After that I
heard loud speaking, quarreling and scolding; and soon
after they cut off Ee’s head. While the quarreling was
going on he was not dead, because I saw him moving his
hands. Afterward many of the assassins stamped upon the
body, and all kicked it; and they afterward hacked the body
all over. They then all ran away.”</p>

<p>The Gorochiu immediately sent a letter to the Emperor:
“This morning (3d day of 3d month), on the Soto Sakurada,
twenty servants of Mito assassinated Kamong no kami. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
fear that Mito may have a design of sending men down to
Miako to seize the Emperor, and gain over the Koongays.
Therefore his Majesty’s government would do well to keep
a strict watch round Miako, and in the six roads leading to
the capital.”</p>

<p>Matzdaira Higo no kami wrote to the Gorochiu: “This
morning there was a serious disturbance at Soto Sakurada.
My soldiers are at your disposal to guard any spot where
you may please to order them.”</p>

<p>The Gorochiu answered, by the usual way of attaching a
small slip of paper to the letter: “We do not require any
more soldiers.”</p>

<p>The Shiogoon ordered Sakkai Sayay mon no jo, who was
now, by the death of the Regent, head of the Tay kan no ma,
or room of the Fudai Daimios, as follows:</p>

<p>“This morning there was a great disturbance in Soto
Sakurada; and afterward there was fighting close to the
Shiogoon’s residence. You must keep all the soldiers under
your command in readiness within your house.”</p>

<p>The Shiogoon also wrote to Higo no kami: “You say you
have your soldiers all ready for any duty they may be called
to. Your loyalty has given me much satisfaction.”</p>

<p>On the 4th day of the 3d month, Okamoto and Soma, the
two principal officers in the late Regent’s service, went to
the Gorochiu with the following letter: “Our master, Kamong
no kami, went out yesterday to go to the castle to pay
his respects. When about half-way between his house and
the gate of the castle, several miscreants fell upon him and
killed him. We have certain information that these assassins
were servants of Mito and Satsuma. Yesterday all the
officers say to us, ‘Wait a little.’ But this business cannot
wait. We wish to know for what reason these men killed
our master. There are, at the present moment, some of
these men secreted in the houses of Wakisaka and Hossokawa—two
Daimios. We wish to see them, and ascertain
from themselves why they killed our master. We desire
that these men may be delivered up to us. All the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
of Hikonay [the Regent’s territory] wish this, and we trust
you will take pity on them and grant their desire.”</p>

<p>To this letter the Gorochiu affixed as answer: “Cannot
do so.”</p>

<p>The following letter was addressed to the Shiogoon by the
son and servants of the late Regent on the day of the murder.
It was written to ascertain whether the law of Japan
would be acted upon in their case, by which the territory of
any officer who had been assassinated is confiscated. “3d
day, 3d month.—Ee Kamong no kami, when going to the
castle to-day, and when near the Sakurada gate, was attacked
by a number of villains. At the time, so much snow
was falling as to make it impossible to see a yard before one.
All the servants of Ee are enraged. There were but few
Ronins and many servants, and they ought to have overpowered
the Ronins. The servants are deeply shamed when they
think of Ee nawo massa (the first of the family in the time
of Iyeyas). Whatever is to become of us we care not; but
the retainers and friends of Ee wish to know whether the
house is, according to the old laws of the empire, to be reduced
in rank and impoverished, or if it is to be entirely
degraded and removed from the territory. We wish to
understand clearly.” This was written in the name of the
young Ee; and was probably written with the view of preparing
to defend themselves and party by an appeal to arms
rather than by submission.</p>

<p>The Shiogoon answered to this: “All your father’s territory
I restore to you his son.”</p>

<p>Here terminates the native account of the assassination.
It gives some insight into the working of the government,
and the unscrupulous means to which the highest magnates
of the land will resort to attain their ends. From the general
tenor of the statements, the extreme hatred of one party
in Japan to foreign intercourse is brought out, and the slight
which the Emperor considered to have been put upon him
by the conclusion of the treaty without his consent and
against his expressed opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>Assassination is the <i>ultima ratio</i> of the desperation of
party weakness. The act implies that the party which has
sanctioned it has no one competent to cope with the individual
removed, or to fill the place which it has made vacant.</p>

<p>The position of the government upon the death of the
Regent was that of helpless inactivity. The sudden removal
of the foremost man of the empire was as the removal of the
fly-wheel from a piece of complicated machinery. The whole
empire stood aghast, expecting and fearing some great political
convulsion. The whole country knew who had been the
active agents in the deed; and perhaps there were at heart
very few who did not feel more or less satisfaction at the
blow given to the party which was responsible for, and instrumental
in, bringing foreigners into the country; and a
civil war or revolution would certainly have followed, had
not every one felt that they were, for the first time in their
history, face to face with an enemy, fear of whom concentrated
all minor feelings, and consolidated them into one
great national determination to rid the land of the hated
foreigners. This was the one policy which the Emperor
demanded of the Shiogoon, which the people looked to the
government to effect, and which the lords and military
classes burned to carry into execution. Were the foreigners
not a mere handful of men, and were such to be allowed to
beard and insult the highest personages in the land with
perfect impunity? Now, when the head of the party, who
was or pretended to be in favor of such a change of the
laws, is struck down, if some representative of the national
feelings would only arise and lead them on, they would follow
to the death in such a glorious cause. But no such
leader appeared. Where was Mito, the rival of the late
Regent? and why did he not come forward to carry out his
own policy at this juncture? The son of the late Regent was
too young and inexperienced to claim his father’s office, or
to assume the leadership of the party. It was the personal
hatred of the two men which had been the moving spring in
the daring action of the Regent, and in the underhand plotting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
of Mito. In all probability the feelings of hostility with
which each regarded the foreigner were equally strong.
Mito said you must admit foreigners, because you cannot
keep them out. He thought we can admit foreigners, and,
if we see fit, afterward turn them out. But Mito was disliked
by the other Daimios, and his name was not sufficient
to rally a strong party, while he<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and the lately degraded
Daimios were now in arrest in their own houses, in territories
which had been transferred to the hands of infants.
They had thus no opportunity for intriguing, having no common
place of meeting out of Yedo, as by law they were prohibited
from going to Miako, and could only come to Yedo
as Daimios, when called there on duty by the government.</p>

<p>In this crisis the only course for the Cabinet to pursue
was to go on quietly, managing the routine of affairs until
time should open up some line of action. The Gorochiu,
therefore, with Neito at its head, and nominally under
Tayass as Regent, continued to carry on the ordinary duties
of government.</p>

<p>Events have shown that the Regent was right in his
judgment of the men whom he sought to remove from his
path as obstacles—Mito, Etsizen, Satsuma, Owarri—as these
have all since his death reappeared as leaders of the party
opposed to his policy in the Obiroma or council of the Kokushu.
Etsizen, afterward known by his retired title Shoongaku,
was the first among these magnates who attempted to
take a lead in the government of Yedo. He had been removed
from his position as Daimio and placed in arrest; but,
having subsequently been released, was able to move about
and obtain an influence in high places. He obtained from
the Emperor a letter [afterward considered a forgery], appointing
him and Awa to fill the place of co-regents, under
the name of Sosai Shoku or Sodangeite. But the fermentation
of revolution had already begun to work, and at such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
time the first actors upon the stage seldom play the prominent
parts they deem themselves fitted to fill. They generally
fail to see the causes of the boiling going on around.
Such a man is like an atom in a pot of boiling water, and
knows and sees nothing of the fire which is causing all the
upturning around him. To even a superficial looker-on at
the state of things in Japan, it was evident that such a dual
condition of government as that then existing could not long
continue to carry on foreign relations. The discord and
weakness arising from the permission of an <i>imperium in
imperio</i> by the exterritoriality clause was greatly increased
by the government attempting to carry on foreign relations
without the consent or against the will of the higher power
in Miako. The two powers must work harmoniously; and
so long as the internal affairs of the empire are the only possible
cause of rupture, the weaker, though more exalted, will
find it to be its interest to be on good terms with the lower
but more powerful, the executive. So soon as the latter
begins to act as supreme power toward other nations, it
places itself in a wrong position, and foreign nations will not
treat with such a pretense. The opposition finds a head in
the Emperor, and the only way to avert a rupture is for the
lower power to give way and to act only as the representative
of the head of the empire. If he fails to see this, he sets
himself against the Emperor, who is then supported, not only
by his own nobility, but also by those powers with whom he
has entered into relations. The party of the Shiogoon deserts
him, and his only <i>rôle</i> is to work with and under the
Emperor; or, if he refuses to do this, civil war ensues, and
he falls.</p>

<p>After the removal of the Gotairo, the Cabinet was able
or permitted to carry on the affairs of State. But while
everything seemed smooth, smoldering powers were at
work preparing for volcanic action. The Kokushu, and
especially those who came to Yedo from the west, were
becoming very much irritated about the question of foreigners
in the country, and foreign ministers in Yedo. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
latter assumed a position of superiority to which these lords
were quite unaccustomed. They were occupying temples
belonging to great families, situated in cemeteries consecrated
by the burial of their ancestors and relatives, but now
polluted by intruders hateful to the spirits of the country.
The foreign merchants were able to beard these princes on
the highroad, and to treat with nonchalance dignitaries who
looked for the utmost deference, and who were authorized
by law to punish at their own hands any real or supposed
insolence or insult. On the other hand, they saw trade
pushing its way in the country; silk which had been sold
for 100 dollars was now bringing 1,000, and Emperor and lord
longed to share in such advantages and participate in the
profits. The first object which the more powerful of the
Kokushu set themselves to accomplish was to break down
this intolerable subjection to the Yedo government. This
was not difficult to do, as the power of the empire was in the
hands of a delicate lad, and the Emperor, through whom
the end was brought about, was promised and hoped that
the power would revert to him. The agents in this act were
Shoongaku, Shimadzu saburo, Choshiu, and a Koongay
Ohara—a distant relative and the unexpected successor of
a Koongay, and who had spent his early life hanging about
the offices of Yedo. After the boy-Shiogoon had been married
to Kadsu mia, sister of the Emperor, Shoongaku, who
was always full of the most economical if not parsimonious
views, reduced the retinue and court of the Shiogoon till it
was brought into contempt with the populace. In October,
1862, these potentates produced a letter (forged, as is generally
believed) from the Emperor, putting an end to the
routine of the Yedo court; and having the power in their
own hands, they immediately proclaimed the edict and carried
it into execution. The order was to the effect that the
higher Daimios were to visit Yedo only once in seven years,
and that the wives and families of all the Daimios were to
live at their own provincial seats. This removed from Yedo
all the luster of the court. At the same time these lords<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
filled up the complement of their design by inducing the
Emperor to call most of the higher Daimios who were of
their own views to Miako. The Mikado was swayed hither
and thither as the one party or the other gained the power
in the capital; and so at one time Kanso, the retired lord
of Hizen, had the ear of the Emperor in the interest of the
Shiogoon, while Choshiu appeared to have taken up arms
against his sovereign. But he seems all along to have acted
loyally and patriotically in showing an intense hatred to the
foreigners who were by force of arms thrusting themselves
and their regiments into the country. This act was the
great blow which broke up the power and brought to a
termination the dynasty of Iyeyas. He had foreseen and
made provision for intestine war and revolution, but had not
been able to provide for a treaty with foreign nations and an
exterritoriality clause.</p>

<p>In 1861 the foreign ministers, up to that time resident in
Yedo, retired to Yokohama, and pressed one demand after
another upon the Japanese government, already sufficiently
occupied with complications arising from intestine difficulties.
The Cabinet was worried by requests for interviews
upon questions of land, of residences, of money exchanges,
of matters of etiquette in interviews with the Shiogoon, and
other matters which might seem trivial in comparison with
the crisis through which the country was passing in the face
of an internal revolution. These foreign ministers were
now, somewhat unreasonably, all demanding that residences
should be built for them by the Japanese government, and
insisting that these residences should (in the face of an article
of the treaty to the contrary) be fortified and furnished
with guns. The recreation ground of the people of Yedo,
Go teng yama, was demanded and given up for this purpose
by Ando, then Prime Minister, and a large building
was erected by the Japanese government upon this site;
but the feelings of the people at this unjust appropriation
of a piece of ground which had been set apart for their use
were so much excited that another local <i>émeute</i> was threatened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
at Yedo. This was allayed by the burning of the new
building, and by the attempted assassination of the Prime
Minister, who narrowly escaped with the loss of an ear.</p>

<p>By these annoyances occurring in the neighborhood of
Yedo, and through the presence of foreigners, a strong party
was drawn over to the views of the Emperor, and the nation
began to see that he had all along been in the right in opposing
the admission of foreigners as detrimental to the quiet of
the country. Satsuma and Choshiu built each a large new
residence in Miako. The Emperor called on twelve of the
wealthiest among the Daimios to keep each a sufficient body
of troops in the city for his protection. The young Shiogoon
was invited or called upon to pay a visit to Miako when
Stotsbashi was intriguing against him. He accordingly
went with Kanso, the retired prince of Hizen, while Higo
was appointed Shugo shoku, or guardian of the palace.
This meeting of the Emperor and the Shiogoon seems to
have opened the eyes of both to the power and intelligence
of foreigners, of which the Emperor and his court seem to
have been ignorant. Some of the Miako nobility went out
on a trip with the Shiogoon in his steamer, and were astonished
and converted; and Anega Koji was assassinated for
expressing too plainly and openly his opinions as to the
power and energy of foreigners.</p>

<p>The intercourse between the two heads of the empire
seems to have consolidated the power of the government,
and promised to bring forth fruit in a mutual good understanding
and co-operation. Stotsbashi sneaked away to Yedo
in disgrace, and had to run the gantlet of an attack on his
way back, when his chief secretary was assassinated on the
highroad at Saka no shta. Shimadzu and Choshiu retired
from Miako in disgrace to their respective provincial residences,
where they brooded over their own position and that
of the empire. They could not but feel that it was the loyalty
of their views which had entailed on them their present
disgrace, and the prime cause of this was the foreigners.
They knew well that the feeling of every one of their countrymen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
was with them, and they seem to have at last determined
to throw themselves into the breach by bringing about
a quarrel between the government and some foreign nation.
Shimadzu, the father of the Daimio, then a minor, determined
to carry out the laws of the country irrespective of
any exterritoriality clauses. On leaving Yedo, on September
14, 1862, he gave out that he would cut down any foreigners
he might chance to meet upon the road; when, as
he approached Kanagawa, meeting three gentlemen and a
lady, he ordered his retainers to cut them down, and Mr.
Richardson, wounded and unable to ride away more than
two hundred yards, was set upon, fainting from loss of
blood, and brutally murdered. Justice was asked from the
Shiogoon’s government and the punishment of the offender,
who was well known to all Japan. The murder of a merchant
by a lord like Satsuma was treated with contempt, and
the matter was referred by the British Minister to H.M. government.
The subsequent necessary delay of many months,
before instructions came out to demand an indemnity and
the punishment of the offender, raised the courage of the
party opposed to foreigners, and Choshiu determined on his
part to carry out the laws of the country according to his
instructions. He held a commission from the Emperor as
guardian of the Straits of Simo no seki, the narrow western
entrance to the “inner sea.” He had thereby a right to
overhaul all vessels passing through this strait. There is
no other sea quite analogous: it resembles, but is much
narrower than, the Dardanelles, the Sound, the Straits of
Dover, or Tarifa, at all of which places some recognition of
the power of the nation to defend a vulnerable point of her
territories has been allowed in the exercise of certain surveillance
over passing vessels. Choshiu fired upon some foreign
vessels passing through this strait. The consequence of this
was a combined attack by English, French and Dutch, by
which he or one of his relatives (by error) suffered severely
in men, ammunition and prestige. The Shiogoon disavowed
his proceedings, and to satisfy foreign demands proposed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
punish the rebel This, however, he found to be no easy
matter, as the whole troops and populace were in favor of
Choshiu and his patriotic attempt, and the Shiogoon was at
last obliged to make terms with the Daimio.</p>

<p>Choshiu had presented the following memorial to the
government upon the position of Japan in its internal and
external relations at this juncture:</p>

<p>“Allow me, notwithstanding your political discussions
[with the Mikado’s envoys], to give you my opinion respecting
the troubles which foreigners have given us of late years
in asking all kinds of concessions, in addition to the unexpected
troubles which exist in our own country. This combination
of difficulties within and without, occurring at the
same time, and bringing us to a point when our prosperity
or misfortune is decided, keeps my heart day and night in
anxiety, and induces me to give you in confidence my own
feelings upon these subjects.</p>

<p>“I have long thought that union and concord between
the Shiogoon and Mikado, and obedience to the Mikado’s
orders, are highly necessary in keeping up an intercourse
with foreign nations, as I have already said very
often.</p>

<p>“But every one knows that since the great council of
officers, the Shiogoon and Mikado are disunited, which has
occasioned a conflict of parties, and brought with it discord
and trouble.</p>

<p>“I think the reason of this is, that although the signing
of the treaties was forced upon us by urgent circumstances
and pressing events, there are some who maintain that the
reopening of relations with foreigners has occasioned a degradation
of the people, who were so brave and constant ten
years ago, to the state of quiescence and cowardice to which
they are now reduced by their fear of war and of the foreign
powers. These persons who are of this opinion are therefore
in opposition to the acts of the Shiogoon, and say that they
will themselves undertake to set aside the treaties and prepare
the country for war, declaring that the Mikado still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
maintains the old laws of our country, which direct the
expulsion of foreigners.</p>

<p>“Other persons accept, on the contrary, the reopening of
the country, and praise the foreigners, and thus destroy all
confidence in ourselves. They say that the foreigners have
large forces, and that they have great knowledge of arts and
sciences.</p>

<p>“These conflicting opinions trouble the minds of the people.
Unity is force and strength, and discord is weakness;
therefore it would be imprudent to go to war against powerful
and brave enemies with discord in our minds.</p>

<p>“The closing or opening of Japan is a matter of the greatest
moment. That which cannot be shut again should not
have been opened, and that which cannot be opened should
not have been shut.</p>

<p>“The closing of Japan will never be a real closing, and the
opening will never be a real opening, so long as our country
is not restored to its independence, and as long as it is menaced
and despised by foreign countries. Therefore the opening
or closing of Japan is dependent upon the restoration of
our own powers; if that is effected, then war or peace can
be declared.</p>

<p>“The condition upon which this power can be restored to
us is the enlightening of the people, and their union.</p>

<p>“I think the only way to bring about national union is
by solid union between the Shiogoon and Mikado, acting
together as in one body. Should there be war, it can be
brought to an end very easily.</p>

<p>“A time is now come very different from the barbarous
ages, and arising out of the long peace which has prevailed.
Every little child knows the respect it owes to its parents
and masters.</p>

<p>“It will therefore rejoice everybody in this advanced age
to see the Shiogoon hold the Mikado in great respect; and
the whole nation would honor the Shiogoon, and all troubles
would cease, and then only we can be restored to our independence
and power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>“After our independence is restored, it is urgent and
pressing that we reform our military institutions, the naval
sciences, as well as all branches of industry. We should
find out the great advancements and developments of arts
and sciences in other countries. The whole nation must devote
life and soul to the benefit of our state, and we must
learn and study the interior arrangements of foreign lands,
in order that the commerce of our country may flourish in
this important age. I think all this ought to have been
done long since; but nothing of the kind is to be found in
the edicts which have appeared so often during the last
seven years.</p>

<p>“Inventions and improvements pass on with rapidity,
and the time is now come to make all these changes and
improvements; but if our attachment to old customs causes
us to postpone these measures of such great importance, if
these changes are later suddenly forced by circumstances upon
the inhabitants, a very bad impression will be produced,
creating disorder and confusion. These are reasons why
they should be effected now calmly and gradually. I think
that the Mikado will not be disinclined to this, and therefore
I wish that the Shiogoon should act under the orders of the
Mikado, and not conclude matters by his own authority.
He ought to let these designs be known to all the Daimios
in the name of the Mikado; then there will be a general
quiet restored; then the dormant soul of the whole nation
will awake, and will be united in power and in independence;
and then it will display its force and strength to the
other five portions of the universe without anxiety and fear
for our own country.</p>

<p>“I do not write these my sentiments to aid you in your
negotiations, as they may be of little or no use to you, and
only like a drop of water falling into the ocean; but to show
my gratitude for the favors of the Shiogoon, which my ancestors
have enjoyed during centuries.”</p>

<p>The aim of the party opposed to the policy of the Shiogoon
and the admission of foreigners seems to have been to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
poison the mind of the Emperor against the young Shiogoon,
and to embroil the country in a war, by setting the
one against the other. The letters from the Emperor which
have been obtained prove this.</p>

<p>The following letter was conveyed by Shimadzu Saburo
from the Emperor to the Shiogoon about October, 1862:</p>

<p>“I think that the power of the foreigners [Ee jin, wild
men] at the present time in the country is improper; and
the officers of the Kwanto seem to have lost all knowledge
of the right way, and of all plans of action, causing disturbance
all over the empire. All my people [Ban nin, 10,000
men] seem about to fall down into mud as black as charcoal.
On this account I, standing between Ten sho go dai
jin and my people, am very deeply distressed. The Bakuri
[Shiogoon’s officers] have spoken to me, saying, ‘All our people
are agitated, and the Shiogoon has no power to hold up
his arm. Therefore please give us your sister in marriage
[to the Shiogoon]. If you can do this, Miako and Yedo will
be at concord, and the whole power of Japan can join together,
and we can then brush away the Yee teki’ [<i>i.e.</i>,
foreigners, wild enemies].</p>

<p>“In answer, I said, ‘This is right, and I will give my
sister.’</p>

<p>“At that time the Bakuri said to me, ‘In ten years the
foreigners must be brushed away.’ This gave me great
pleasure; and I pray to the spirits every day to help Japan.</p>

<p>“I have now been waiting for a long time for your
brushing away. Why are you so slow?</p>

<p>“With my sister Kadsumia I sent Tchikusa shosho and
Iwakura chiujo, and at the same time granted a general
amnesty;<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and all the business of the government I gave, as
in former times, to the Shiogoon. But this business about
foreigners [Gway-Ee] is of the first importance to the country.
Therefore I said, ‘Let all this foreign business come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
under my care, and I will settle it.’ At the time, all the
Yedo officials answered to me that the Emperor’s proposal
was very important and serious, but a speedy answer cannot
be given, and that we must wait a little.</p>

<p>“After this time, several Daimios proposed several different
stratagems for driving away foreigners. But of all the
Daimios only two—viz., Satsuma and Choshiu—came in person
to speak to me; and all the loyal people from San yodo
[west of Miako], Nan kaido [island of Sikok], and Sai kaido
[island of Kiusiu], came to Miako like bees, and addressed
me secretly. All these tell me that the officers of Yedo are
all bad, and that they are becoming worse from day to day;
and that justice and truth are fallen to the ground; and that
they do not hold the Emperor in respect; and they are friends
of the foreigners, giving them everything they want—silk,
tea, and other things—while the whole country loses. All
the people are much vexed about this; and they feel that
they are becoming the same as servants of the foreigners,
and now their habits cannot change. On this account, these
people of San yodo, Nan kaido, and Sai kaido, and Satsuma
and Mowori [Choshiu], wish to raise the Emperor’s flag.
And they say, that if the Emperor with the flag goes to
Hakonay, the Bakufu [Shiogoon’s office] officers, if bad,
must all be punished.</p>

<p>“Some men say that, Japan having been at peace for a
long time, the spirits of the people are very lazy and slow;
therefore they suggest that a letter should be given to the
Daimios and people of the Go ki stchi do [<i>i.e.</i>, the districts
lying upon the seven roads], ordering that foreigners must
be brushed out of the country.</p>

<p>“The Emperor says: ‘Throughout the empire there are
many loyal and patriotic men, therefore I will speak to Satsuma
and Nagato to desire the people to have patience.’</p>

<p>“I gave a letter to Koozay Yamato no kami, requesting
an answer, and yet none ever came; and last year I wrote
and proclaimed an amnesty, and to this I received no answer.
Why has the Shiogoon thus lost the way? I believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
it is not he, but his officers. All the Gorochiu do not care.
The Ty jiu [great tree] is but young; but I fear that if I
delay but an instant [till I can stand up], all the empire will
be broken up. Therefore I am every day troubled and weeping.
All the officers of the Kwanto [the Shiogoon, Daimios,
etc.] think only of the happiness of a day, and forget the
misery of a hundred years. The holy books thus speak, and
you ought to study them. You ought to keep these virtuous
ideas in your minds, and be ready with your military preparations,
and then you will clearly see your way out, and
brush away the power of the foreign enemies. But while
all Japan is in a state of excitement, I will hold to the medium
course [<i>i.e.</i>, between brushing away immediately and
waiting indefinitely]. Since the Tokungawa family began
[<i>i.e.</i>, since Iyeyas], there has not arisen a question of so
much difficulty. I have three plans to propose: The first
is, that I will gradually bring the Shiogoon and Daimios
and Hattamoto to Miako, and will hold a council about the
government of the country and the brushing away of foreigners.
If we can do this, the anger of heaven and the
gods will be averted. They will rejoice, and the good minds
of the lower classes will return. Then all people will stand
on a strong foundation, and the empire be as strong as a
large mountain.</p>

<p>“My second plan is, you must lean upon the old laws of
Ho taiko [<i>i.e.</i>, Taikosama], and give the laws of the country
and the settlement of the question into the hands of the Tai
hang [<i>i.e.</i>, large fence, or the Kokushiu] and the Gotairo
[<i>i.e.</i>, five elders]. If we do this, the country can keep out
or push back the pressure of foreigners. All round the
coasts military preparations must be made; and so the country
will be strong, and foreigners can be brushed away.</p>

<p>“My third plan is, to order Stotsbashi to assist the Ty jiu
on all internal business, and to give the office of Regent to
Shoongaku, to take charge of the outer relations of the office
at Yedo. In that case both the internal and external business
will be well conducted, and we shall not blush to think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
that we are servants to foreigners, and that they have obliged
us to cross our coats the right over the left side.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> For all
men fear that in a very little time these foreigners will seize
all Japan.</p>

<p>“I think that these three plans should now be considered
and settled, and to that end I send an envoy to Kwanto; but
if they cannot all three be carried out, I wish the officers of
the Shiogoon to examine them and determine on one that
can be carried out. All my servants must be very busy
going round and round, and there is to be no secrecy about
it; but every one is to be diligent, and all must give me a
faithful report.”</p>

<p>At the time this letter was written both Stotsbashi and
Shoongaku were in Miako, whither they had hurried down
before the arrival of the Shiogoon. The letter bears some
internal evidence of being written at their dictation, especially
from the proposal made to appoint the two as Lieutenants
and Regent to or over the Shiogoon; and corroborates
the advice which Kanso had given the young Shiogoon; viz.,
that he should repair at once to Miako, where the enemies
of his power were trying to subvert him.</p>

<p>Not long after this, four Koongays of Miako having been
discovered plotting against the Emperor were degraded and
obliged to shave their heads and retire to monasteries. Koonga
and his son, and the Empress herself, with two concubines,
were said to be implicated in these intrigues. The following
reasons of punishment were published: “During the last five
years intrigues have been carrying on against the Emperor
by the late Gotairo and Sakkye Wakasa no kami. The object
of these intrigues has been to get possession of the Emperor’s
person and banish him to one of the islands (as formerly several
were sent by Ashikanga and Hojio). Sakkye was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
false, and tarnished the bright name of the Emperor, which
is a very foul crime. Now their devices have been discovered,
and the Emperor has ordered the Sisshay [another
name of the Kwanbakku] thus to punish them.”</p>

<p>The punishment inflicted by the British government upon
Satsuma at Kagosima, on account of the murder of Mr.
Richardson, was severe but deserved, and, in a political
view, was completely successful. The two most powerful
lords in the empire had each tried a fall with foreigners and
been worsted. They could no longer press on the government
to brush out these intruders, as they knew now by
experience how far behind the country was in military and
naval tactics and means of warfare. The natural result now
followed—they began to quarrel among themselves. Seeing
their own weakness, however, they instantly began to take
what steps they could to bring themselves up to a higher
standing by the education of their people, and they began
by seeking to acquire a knowledge of steam and steam-vessels.
Choshiu and Satsuma sent young men to England,
arms and ammunition were purchased, steam-factories were
erected for working in iron, military tactics were studied,
professors were appointed in their colleges, and officers were
obtained to drill their young men and teach the use of the rifle.</p>

<p>The fruit expected from the intercourse of the Emperor
and Shiogoon unfortunately did not ripen. The latter returned
to Yedo despoiled of much of the former splendor
of his position. His court was broken up. The greater
lords paid now no deference to him, and the lesser Daimios
began to side with the greater. His party consisted chiefly
of the Kamong Daimios, the relatives of the family of Tokungawa.
Yedo itself was falling into the position of a fading
capital, and, as a place of commercial importance, was
dwindling with the departure of its political greatness. A
feeble attempt was made to recall the edict and re-establish
the old order of things in Yedo; but events rolled on, and
things are shaping themselves in totally different order from
that proposed by the ruling powers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>The defeat of Satsuma by the English navy at Kagosima
separated that Daimio from the party of Choshiu and
others, and his counsels to the Emperor were those of peace.
Shimadzu Saburo paid the indemnity demanded of him, and
gave assurances that the offender should be given up when
discovered, which was perhaps as much as could be expected
from one who, while a murder was being committed
by his orders, was quietly sitting within ten feet of
his victim.</p>

<p>The Shiogoon Iyay mutchi had found nothing but trouble
and anxiety from his elevation to the seat of power in the
year 1859. In 1866 his health began to give way, and he
shortly after died, leaving no children, and the way became
open to his rival, Stotsbashi. The period was critical, and
the ablest man would have found difficulty in steering through
the dangers surrounding the vessel of state. The Daimios
would now have little hesitation in withholding their allegiance
to another Kubosama until it should be settled who was
to be the <i>de facto</i> ruler of the empire—the Emperor or the
Shiogoon. Many would see that some change must take
place in the internal constitution of the empire now when
the government must deal as one body with foreign nations.
The necessity for dual government was at an end. The
mouthpiece of the nation must be one, and give no uncertain
sound. The internal resources must be gathered into
one treasury. The police, the taxes, must be recognized as
national, and not as belonging to one petty chief here and
there. The army and navy required reconstruction; and
the power of the feudal lords would have to be broken down
in order to be reconstituted into one strong state under one
head.</p>

<p>The new Shiogoon, Yoshi hisa, attempted to assume the
power with the position held by his ancestors, but he was
too late. His only true policy was to stand beside and support
the Emperor while the lower chiefs impoverished themselves
by fighting. He attempted to take a side against the
Emperor, but not being aided by a strong party, he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
forced in 1867 to give way, and by abdicating retire into
temporary obscurity.</p>

<p>To add still more to the critical position of affairs in Japan
at this time, the Emperor died, being about thirty-eight years
of age, and leaving a young boy as his heir and successor.
It does not clearly appear who has been pulling the strings
of political action on the part of the boy-Emperor; but there
can be little doubt but that the two Daimios to whom Yedo
was the most grievous offense, and whose ancestors had
smarted from the rise of the Tokungawa family under
Iyeyas, Satsuma and Choshiu, have not been idle. On the
other hand, the wealthy Daimios from the north—Sendai,
and other Kamong or relatives of that family—seemed determined
to uphold the position of the family, and carry out
the principles of Iyeyas at all hazards. Between these parties
the Shiogoon, who is said to be an able man, tried to
steer a neutral course until he saw what would turn up.
At length he came to think that submission to the Emperor
was the true policy for himself and for the empire, and
he humbly placed himself at the disposal of the Emperor
rather than involve the country in another civil war. His
submission was accepted by the Emperor in the following
terms:</p>

<p>“The conduct of Tokungawa Yoshi hisa having proceeded
to such an extreme as to be properly called an insult to the
whole empire, and having caused the deepest pain to the
mind of the Emperor, both sea and land forces were sent to
punish him. Hearing, however, that he is sincerely penitent,
and lives in retirement, the excess of the imperial compassion
shall be exhausted, and the following commands be
enjoined upon him. Let him be respectfully obedient to
them. A period of eleven days is granted him in which
to comply with all these orders.</p>

<p>“1st, Yoshi hisa having, on the 12th month of the last
year, and afterward, insulted the Emperor, attacked the
imperial city, and fired upon the imperial flag, was guilty
of a most heinous crime. The army was accordingly sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
out to pursue and punish him. But as he has manifested
sincere contrition and obedience, has shut himself up in retirement,
and begs that his crime may be pardoned: in consideration
of the no small merit of his family, which, since
the time of his ancestors, for more than two hundred years
has administered the affairs of government, and more especially
of the accumulated meritorious services of Mito zo
Dainagoon [the father of Yoshi hisa, and rival of the Regent];
for these various considerations, of which we are
most profoundly sensible, we give him the following commands,
which if he obeys we will deal leniently with him,
grant that the house of Tokungawa be established [<i>i.e.</i>, not
destroyed from the list of Daimios], remit the capital punishment
his crimes deserve, but command him to go to the
castle of Mito, and there live shut up in retirement.</p>

<p>“2d, The castle [of the Shiogoon in Yedo] to be vacated,
and delivered over to the Prince of Owarri.</p>

<p>“3d, All the ships of war, cannon and small arms to be
delivered up; when a proper proportion shall be returned
[to the head of the house of Tokungawa, which is reduced
to the rank of an ordinary Daimio].</p>

<p>“4th, The retainers living in the castle shall move out
and go into retirement.</p>

<p>“5th, To all those who have aided Yoshi hisa, although
their crimes are worthy of the severest punishment, the sentence
of death shall be remitted, but they are to receive such
other punishment as you shall decide on. Let this be reported
to the imperial government. This, however, does
not include those persons who have an income of more than
10,000 koku—<i>i.e.</i>, Daimios; the imperial government alone
will punish such.”</p>

<p>An important political step has been taken within the last
few months, during the present year 1869. The Daimios
appear to have become aware of the weakness which inevitably
accompanies division, and of the strength which would
be gained to the country by consolidation and unification
under one head. The threatening position taken up by some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
or all of the foreign nations with whom treaties of friendship
had been concluded brought up the subject at some of the
recent great councils. The crushing defeats which had
fallen upon Satsuma and Choshiu warned individual Daimios
of their weakness as units in carrying on operations of
war; the enormous expense entailed upon them in procuring
munitions of war, and in exercise, and in the purchase of
steamers, alarmed these lords in the prospect of annihilation
from exhaustion, and they came to the conclusion that such
expenses could only be borne by the empire as a whole, and
that to gain such an advantage the privileges of the class
must in some degree be given up. The removal of the Shiogoon
presented a favorable opportunity for carrying out the
proposal, and they agreed heartily to restore all their fiefs
into the hands of the Emperor, and to give up the exclusive
privileges which each held in his own state, that these might
all be thrown into one government, with one exchequer, one
army, and one navy. The latest accounts confirm this cession
of their independent rights—in which cession Satsuma,
the most powerful, but the Daimio who suffered most from
the independent system in the very severe punishment which
he received in loss of men, destruction of steamers, and payment
of indemnity, with total loss of prestige and position as
a military power, has been foremost. It is therefore reasonable
to suppose that henceforth there will be only one responsible
ruling power in Japan.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>EVENTS FOLLOWING THE ABOLITION OF THE SHIOGOONATE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Dickson’s</span> history was published in 1869. During
the years that have since elapsed we have witnessed a
complete transformation of Japan. To make intelligible
the sequence of events, it may be well to describe more in
detail the incidents which preceded, attended and immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
followed the downfall of the Tokungawa Shiogoonate
which, for more than two and a half centuries, had possessed
the substance of power in Japan, only the shadow
thereof being retained by the Mikado. Within less than a
year after January 6, 1867, when Keiki had been made Shiogoon,
much against his will, the Prince of Tosa and many
able representatives of the Daimio and Samurai castes urged
him to resign and permit a government to be constituted on
the principles which had prevailed in the ante-Shiogoon era,
namely, before the year <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1200. In November, 1867,
Keiki so far yielded to public opinion as to tender his resignation;
but, as the Aidzu clan, which was stanchly loyal to
him, continued to guard the Mikado’s palace, it remained for
a time uncertain whether Keiki might not resume his functions.
Ultimately, a combination was formed by the Satsuma,
Choshiu, Tosa, Etsizen and other clans, whereby the
followers of the Tokungawa family were expelled from
the imperial palace and an edict was issued in the name of
the young Mikado, Mutsuhito, to the effect that the office
of Shiogoon was abolished, and that the government of
Japan would be henceforth carried on by the Mikado himself.
A provisional administrator was appointed, and all
the important civil and military posts were allotted to unflinching
upholders of the prospective regime. The ex-Shiogoon,
however, was persuaded by his retainers to retract his
resignation, and, at the head of a large force, he undertook
to re-enter Kioto [Miako] for the purpose of reasserting his
former authority. After a battle, which lasted three days,
he was beaten by the loyal troops and was forced to take
refuge in his castle, where he announced that he would
never again take up arms against the Mikado. Nevertheless,
the Tokungawa clan showed, for a time, signs of disaffection;
but by July 1, 1869, all vestiges of rebellion had
ceased and the Mikado’s party was triumphant. The trials
of the new government now began. The Kuge, or court
nobles, and the whole body of Samurai, or two-sworded
men, desired to drive foreigners out of the country, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
Okubo, Goto and Kido, who were conversant with foreign
ideas, opposed the execution of the plan and sent a noble of
the imperial court to give the Mikado’s consent to the treaties
and to invite the foreign Ministers to an audience with
the Emperor in Kioto. The conversion of the court nobles
to the party that desired to see Japan reconstructed on
European principles now went on rapidly, and the young
Mikado was induced to appear in person before the Council
of State and to promise that a deliberative assembly should
be eventually formed. Indicative of an intention to revolutionize
the mode of government was the Emperor’s departure
from Kioto, which had been the seat of his ancestors for
twenty-five centuries, and his adoption of Yedo, thenceforth
called Tokio, for his capital. To a considerable extent, freedom
of the press was now guaranteed, and a number of newspapers
sprung up. Books expounding European methods of
thought and education were published, and many pamphlets
advocating the abolition of feudalism appeared. Four of
the great Daimios, or feudal lords, advocated the change.
They addressed a memorial to the throne offering to restore
the registers of their clans and proposing that the Mikado
should resume possession of their fiefs. In conformity to
this request, an edict was issued in September, 1871, summoning
the Daimios to Tokio for the purpose of arranging
their retirement to private life. With scarcely an exception,
the order was obeyed; even the Daimios who disapproved of
the measure were unwilling to oppose the resolute men who
had framed the edict. The truth is that, even under the
feudal system, the real power in each clan had lain in the
hands of able men of inferior rank who ruled their nominal
masters. These are the men who, during the last thirty
years, have controlled Japan. Having first driven the Shiogoon
into private life, they then compelled the Daimios to
follow him into retirement. Of the men who have governed
the country since 1868, not one is a Daimio by birth, and
only two or three are Kuge, or court nobles. Almost all
were simple Samurai, or retainers of the territorial lords.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>It should be mentioned that, in 1869, the Emperor returned
to Kioto for a brief visit, in order to perform certain
ceremonies at his father’s tomb, and, during his sojourn in
the western capital, he married the present Empress, who
was a princess of one of the five regent families, from which
the highest officers under the Mikado have always been selected,
and from which the emperors have habitually chosen
their wives.</p>

<p>We have seen that the Emperor had promised to convoke
a deliberative assembly. This promise was, at first, kept to
the ear, rather than the hope. A so-called Kogisho or Parliament
was formed of persons representing each of the Daimiates,
and designated for the position by the Daimios. It was
a mere debating society, whose function was to give advice
to the imperial government. How conservative the advice
given by this body was may be measured by the fact that it
refused to recommend the abolition of the privilege of hari-kari,
or of the custom of wearing swords. This Kogisho
lasted only for some months, being dissolved in the autumn
of the same year in which it was created.</p>

<p>Soon after the suppression of the feudal system in Japan,
the Daimiates, considered as administrative areas, were superseded
by Prefectures. At first, the ex-Daimios were appointed
Prefects, but most of them were soon found to be
unfit for high executive office, and they have been gradually
replaced by competent persons drawn from the Samurai class.
It should further be noted that the extinction of feudalism
imposed some onerous financial obligations. It was decided
that each ex-Daimio, and each of the sub-feudatories that
had been dependent on him, should receive one-tenth of the
income which they had drawn from their fiefs. This income
was to be free from any claim for the support of the Samurai
who had formed the standing army in each clan. The central
government undertook to make all payments to the Samurai
for services of any kind. The assumption of this burden
compelled the government to borrow $165,000,000. In
lieu of the pensions which they had formerly received, lump<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
sums were given to the Samurai, but these were soon squandered,
and much poverty and want were eventually experienced
by the ex-feudal retainers. Among other remarkable
events which took place in 1871, should be mentioned the
removal of the ancient disqualification of the <i>eta</i> and <i>heimin</i>,
whereby these pariah castes were placed on the same
legal footing as the rest of the population. In the following
year, the first railway in Japan was opened. This was a
line between Yokohama and Tokio. In 1873, the European
calendar was adopted, so far as the beginning of the year
and the beginning of the months are concerned. The year
is still reckoned, however, from Jimmu Tenno, which is 1873
of the Christian era, and corresponds to the year 2533 of the
Japanese era. Still employed occasionally, also, is the Meiji
year-period, which began in 1868.</p>

<p>From the beginning of 1872, the remodeling of the Japanese
system of education was undertaken. In April of
that year, the Mikado, Mutsuhito, visited the Imperial College,
subsequently to be known as the Imperial University.
The new buildings consisted of three wings, each 192 feet
long, joined to a main edifice 324 feet in length. The students
in this institution soon numbered 350, taught by 20
foreign professors. The foreign language school, in which
pupils learned English or some other European language,
preparatory to entering the college, presently had 600 students
and 20 foreign teachers. For educational purposes,
the empire was divided into eight districts, in each of which
a university was contemplated, which was to be supplied by
210 secondary schools of foreign languages. It was arranged
that the elementary vernacular schools should number
53,000, or one for every 600 persons in Japan. To these
elementary establishments were to be deputed native teachers
trained in normal schools. Before many years had
passed, the school attendance was computed at three
millions.</p>

<p>During the year 1872, two legations and three consulates
were established abroad. Before long, the number was increased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
to ten. The Japanese press quickly emerged from
the realm of experiment and became a powerful civilizing
force. In the course of a few years, ten daily newspapers
in the capital and 200 publications in the empire, equipped
with metal type and printing presses, began to flood the
country with information and awaken thought. In the department
of jurisprudence, also, great progress was made.
Since the restoration of the Mikado to actual power, revised
statutes have greatly decreased the list of capital punishments;
the condition of the prisons has been ameliorated;
legal processes have been improved from the viewpoint of
justice, and the use of torture to obtain testimony has been
entirely abolished. Law schools were established, and to
accused persons was given the assistance of counsel for their
defense. By the year 1874, there had been a great change
for the better in the diet, clothing, and hygienic protection
of the people. In the year named, there were in the empire
one government hospital and twenty-one hospitals assisted
by government grants, twenty-nine private hospitals, 5,247
physicians practicing according to the principles and methods
of Western science, and 5,205 apothecaries. In 1875,
there were 325 students in the medical colleges at Tokio
and Nagasaki, and there were some twenty-five foreign surgeons
and physicians in the employ of the Japanese government.
Public decency was improved and the standards of
Christendom approached. The sale of orphan female children
to brothel keepers, the traffic in native or European
obscene pictures, lascivious dances, the exhibition of nude
singing girls, the custom of promiscuous bathing in the public
baths, and the toleration of nakedness on the part of the
rural coolies were brought to an end. Religious persecution
ceased. All the native Christians who had been exiled or
imprisoned in 1868-69 were set free and restored to their
villages. We note, finally, that, as early as 1876, the fulfillment
of the promise made by the Mikado in 1868, that
“intellect and learning should be sought for throughout the
world,” had been so far fulfilled that 400 foreigners from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
many Western countries had been invited to occupy posts
in the government civil service. In 1870, there had been
not ten Protestant Christians in the empire. By May, 1876,
there were ten Protestant churches, with a membership of
800 souls. In March of the year just named, Prime Minister
Sanjo issued a proclamation abolishing the custom of
wearing two swords. This measure, which had been first
advocated by Arinori Mori in 1870, now became law throughout
the land. It was in August, 1876, that the commutation
of the hereditary pensions and life incomes of the Samurai,
which previously had been optional, was made compulsory.
This act forced the privileged classes to begin to earn their
bread. In the same month, the empire was redivided and
the 68 Ken, or Prefectures, were reduced in number to 35.
It was to be expected that the progressive course of the
Mikado’s Ministers would excite some disaffection. There
were during this year some insurrections on the part not
only of discontented Samurai, but also of the farmers on
whom the burdens of taxation mainly fell. It was to redress
the grievances of the agricultural class that, in January,
1877, the national land tax was reduced from 3 to 2½
per cent, while the local tax, which had formerly amounted
to one-third of the land tax, was cut down to one-fifth.
About the same time, the salaries of nearly all the government
officers were diminished, several thousand office-holders
were discharged, the Department of Revision and the Prefecture
of Police were abolished, and their functions were
transferred to the Home Department. An annual saving of
about eight million dollars was thus effected, and the loss to
the Treasury from the curtailment of land taxation was made
good. In 1877, however, a great rebellion broke out in
Satsuma, instigated by Saigo Takamori, who had been
formerly a marshal of the empire. After a contest of some
months, the imperial authority was everywhere re-established,
and Saigo, at his own request, was beheaded by one
of his friends. This insurrection represented the final struggle
between the forces of feudalism and misrule against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
order and unity. The contest cost Japan $50,000,000 and
many thousands of lives. In the ultimate treatment of the
rebels, the government displayed a spirit of leniency worthy
of an enlightened state. Of upward of 38,000 persons tried
in Kiushiu, only twenty were decapitated, about 1,800 were
condemned to imprisonment, and some 36,000 were pardoned.
During the same year, 1877, the cholera broke out in Japan,
but, owing to the enforcement of sanitary measures, there
were but 6,297 deaths.</p>

<p>The Mikado had now been governing Japan for ten years
by means of an irresponsible Ministry. The oath which he
had taken at Kioto in 1868 to form a deliberative assembly
had never been fully carried out. We have seen that the
Kogisho, or advisory body, called into existence in 1868,
had been dissolved in the same year. Subsequently, in
1875, a Senate had been established and an assembly of the
ken governors, or prefects, held one session. The meetings
of the latter body, however, were soon indefinitely postponed.
Nevertheless, the era of personal government was
drawing to a close. On July 22, 1878, a long step was taken
toward representative institutions by an edict convoking provincial
parliaments or local assemblies which were to sit once
a year in each ken or province. Under the supervision of
the Minister of the Interior, these bodies were empowered to
discuss questions of local taxation, and to petition the central
government on other matters of local interest. There were
both educational and property qualifications of the franchise.
Each voter had to prove his ability to read and write, and he
must have paid an annual land tax of at least five dollars.
In October, 1881, the Mikado announced by a proclamation
that, in 1890, a Parliament would be established. In June,
1884, an edict was issued readjusting the system of nobility.
In the newly created orders of princes, marquises, counts,
viscounts and barons, were observed the names of many men
who had once belonged to the class of Samurai, or gentry,
but who had earned promotion by distinguished services on
behalf of their country. Three hundred persons, that may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
be described as pertaining to the aristocracy of intellect, were
thus ennobled on the score of merit. It was expected that
out of these newly created nobles would be constituted the
upper house, or Chamber of Notables, in the Parliament
which was to come into being in 1890. In December, 1885,
the triple premiership, the Privy Council and the Ministries,
as they had been hitherto established, came to an end. In
their place was created a Cabinet, at the head of which was
a Minister-President. The old government boards, together
with a new board, which was to supervise the post-office,
telegraph and railway, were organized in such a way as to
discharge many thousand office-holders. All the members
of the new Cabinet were men of modern ideas, and such
Asiatic features as the government had hitherto retained
were now extinguished. By 1886, notable progress had been
made in the applications of steam and electricity. Of railroads
there were already 265 miles open, 271 miles in course
of construction, and 543 miles contemplated. Although these
lines were built and equipped on British models, most of the
surveying, engineering and constructive work and all of the
mechanical labor were performed by natives. The trains
and engines were worked by Japanese; such light materials
as were made of wood and metal were manufactured in Japan,
only the heavy castings, the rails and the engines being
brought from Great Britain. The telephone and the electric
light were now seen in the large cities, and four cables connected
the island empire with the Asiatic mainland. Already
the Japan Mail Shipping Company employed a large fleet of
steamships and sailing vessels in their coasting trade and passenger
lines. We add that, in 1885, the Postal Department
forwarded nearly 100,000,000 letters and packages.</p>

<p>The Japanese had, for some time, recognized that education
is the basis of progress, and that their efforts for intellectual
advancement were seriously impeded by their use of
the Chinese graphic system. They perceived that what they
needed most of all was an alphabet. In 1884, the Roma-ji-Kai,
or Roman Letter Association, was formed in Tokio,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
and, within two years, had 6,000 members, native and foreign.
As their name implies, their purpose was to supplant
the Chinese character and native syllabary by the Roman
alphabet, as the vehicle of Japanese thought. It was demonstrated
that all possible sounds and vocal combinations
could be expressed by using twenty-two Roman letters. It
was further proved that, by means of the Roman alphabet,
a child could learn to read the colloquial and book language
in one-tenth of the time formerly required. Scarcely was
the Roman Letter Association under way than it printed a
newspaper, edited text-books, and transliterated popular and
classic texts in the appropriate characters of the Roman
alphabet. By an imperial decree, issued in November, 1884,
the English language was made part of the order of study
in the common schools. Meanwhile, the progress of Christianity
acquired considerable momentum. Not only were
many converts made by Catholic missionaries, but, by the
end of 1885, there were 200 Protestant churches, with a
membership of over 13,000. In December, 1885, the Mikado’s
Cabinet was reorganized, and, during the next four
years, Ito and Inouye were the principal molders of the national
policy. In April, 1888, a new body called the Privy
Council was created, of which Ito became President, while
Kuroda filled the position of Prime Minister. In this body,
active debate upon the forthcoming Constitution began in
May of the year last-named, and proceeded until February
11, 1889, when the long-awaited instrument was proclaimed.
Exactly thirty-five years after the American treaty-ships appeared
in sight of Idzu, the Mikado, Mutsuhito, took oath
to maintain the government according to the Constitution,
the documents defining which he, before an audience of
nobles, officials and foreign envoys, handed to Kuroda, the
principal Minister of State. On this occasion, for the first
time in Japan’s history, the Emperor rode beside the Empress
in public. The one blot upon the record of the day
was the assassination of the Minister of Education, Arinori
Mori, by a Shintoist fanatic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>Let us glance at some of the features of Japan’s fundamental
organic law. The Constitution proper consists of
sixty-six articles, but, simultaneously with it, two hundred
and sixty-six expositionary laws were proclaimed. In the
first place, the Mikado’s person was declared sacred and inviolable.
In him continued to be concentrated the rights of
sovereignty, which, however, he was to exercise according
to the provisions of the organic law. A Diet or Parliament
was created to meet once a year, and to be opened, closed,
prorogued and dissolved by the Emperor. Its debates are
public. The Mikado’s Ministers may take seats and speak
in either House, but are accountable, not to the Diet, but to
the Emperor alone. Bills raising revenue and appropriating
the same require the consent of the Diet, but certain fixed
expenditures, provided for by the Constitution, cannot be
abolished or curtailed without the concurrence of the Executive.
To a large extent, the power over the purse is thus
withheld from the representatives of the people. The tenure
of judges is for good behavior. The Upper House consists
partly of hereditary, partly of elected, and partly of nominated
members; the combined number, however, of the members
of the two last-named classes is not to exceed that of
those who hold heritable titles of nobility. The House of
Representatives consists of about 300 members, who serve
four years. For them there is a property qualification; they
must pay annually national taxes to the amount of fifteen
yen or dollars. Those who elect them must also pay national
taxes to the same amount. Those persons who pay
taxes to the amount of over five yen are entitled to vote for
members of the local assembly. These numbered, in 1887,
about 1,500,000, whereas the electorate of the national House
of Representatives numbered only about 300,000. We observe,
lastly, that certain fundamental rights were guaranteed
to the Japanese people. They have, for instance, the
right of changing their domicile. Except according to law,
they are not to be arrested, detained or punished. They are
also to enjoy the right of freedom from search, the inviolability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
of letters, freedom of religious belief and the liberty
of speech, petition, writing, publishing, association and public
meeting within the limits of laws to be laid down by the
national Parliament.</p>

<p>The threefold election—namely, for a fraction of the Upper
House, for the whole of the national House of Representatives,
and for the local assembly—took place in July,
1890. About eighty-five per cent of eligible voters availed
themselves of the franchise, and there was a great superfluity
of candidates. It turned out at the ballot-box that to be
in any way connected with government employment was to
invite almost certain defeat, while, on the other hand, few
of the old party leaders were chosen as standard-bearers in
the new Parliamentary field. We add that, on April 22,
1890, a new code of civil procedure, and the first portion of
a Civil Code, were promulgated; since 1881, a new Criminal
Code based on the principles of Western jurisprudence has
been in successful operation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>FOREIGN POLICY OF NEW JAPAN AND WAR WITH CHINA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> will be convenient to consider separately the foreign
policy which was gradually evolved after the transformation
of Japan that followed the Mikado’s resumption of actual
power. Scarcely had the Shiogoon been overthrown than
the desire of conquest and expansion was reawakened. Representatives
of the advanced school of Japanese ideas presently
maintained that the national jurisdiction should include
not only Yezo, Saghalien and the Bonin islands, but also
Corea and the eastern part of Formosa, the last claim being
based upon settlements made by the Japanese. The Bonin
islands, first occupied by Ogasawara, a Daimio, in 1593, and
visited by a party of explorers from Nagasaki in 1675, had
been neglected by the Japanese for centuries, though long a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
noted resort of whalers. In 1878, the islands were formally
reoccupied in the name of the Mikado, and a local government
established by Japanese officers. Saghalien and the
Kurile islands had been a debatable ground between the
Japanese and the Russians since 1790, and had been the scene
of a good deal of bloodshed. In 1875, Admiral Enomoto concluded
at St. Petersburg a convention by which Russia received
the whole of Saghalien, while Japan obtained all the
Kurile islands. The large island of Yezo was administered
by a special department until the year 1882, when it was
divided into three ken, or prefectures, which are governed
like the rest of the empire. Let us glance, next, at Japan’s
assumption of sovereignty over the little island kingdom of
Riu Kiu, or Loo Choo, an assumption which subjected the
relations between China and Japan to severe tension. These
islands are strung like a long thread between Japan and Formosa.
For many centuries, these islanders sent tribute to
both China and Japan. Toward the close of the sixteenth
century, Hideyoshi demanded that they should pay tribute
to Japan alone; but he never enforced his demands. In
1609, Iyehisa, the Daimio of Satsuma, conquered the islands,
and made their chiefs swear allegiance to his house and to
the Shiogoon. Between 1611 and 1850, no fewer than fifteen
embassies from Riu Kiu visited Yedo to obtain investiture
for the island king, or to congratulate a Shiogoon upon his
accession to power. The same policy, however, was pursued
toward China also. After the revolution of 1868 the Loo
Choo islands were made a dependency of the Japanese empire,
and the king acknowledged the Mikado for his suzerain.
Some five years later, the Japanese reduced the king
to the status of a retired Daimio, and transformed Riu Kiu
into a ken, or prefecture. To this the islanders objected, and
continued to send a tribute-junk to Ningpo, and implored
China’s interposition. The Pekin government, on its part,
considered that Japan, by its annexation of the Loo Choo
islands, had wrongfully cut off a fringe of the robe of the
Middle Kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>Let us now glance at Japan’s connection with Formosa,
before examining, somewhat in detail, her much more important
relations to Corea. It was toward the end of 1873
that a Loo Choo junk was wrecked on the eastern shore of
Formosa; the crew were killed by the savage inhabitants
of that region, and, as it was reported, eaten. The Loo
Choo islanders appealed to their hereditary suzerain at Satsuma,
who referred the matter to Tokio. As it happened,
China laid no claim to the eastern part of Formosa, and no
trace of it appeared on the maps of the Middle Kingdom.
In the spring of 1874, the Mikado dispatched Soyejima as
Embassador to Pekin, and his representative there obtained
an audience with the Chinese Emperor. The Tsungli Yamen
disclaimed responsibility for eastern Formosa, and conceded
the right of Japan to chastise the savages there. While
Soyejima was absent in China, a Japanese junk was wrecked
in Formosa, and its crew were stripped and plundered. On
the return of the Embassy, 1,300 Japanese soldiers, under the
command of Saigo Yorimichi, were ordered to avenge the
outrage, and, after a few skirmishes with savages, they proceeded
to occupy the eastern part of Formosa. There they
built roads, organized camps, and directed fortifications in
accordance with the principles of modern engineering and
military art. Incited, it is said, by foreign influence, the
Chinese government now began to urge its claims upon the
whole of Formosa, and to denounce the Japanese as intruders.
For a time war seemed inevitable, but the result of the
negotiations, intrusted to Okubo, who was sent to Pekin,
was that the Chinese paid an indemnity of $700,000, and the
Japanese evacuated the island. The abortive expedition had
cost Japan $5,000,000 and seven hundred lives.</p>

<p>Japan’s relations with Corea were to have much more
momentous consequences. During the Tokungawa period,
the so-called Hermit Kingdom had sent regularly embassies
conveying homage to Japan; but, not relishing the change
which the latter country underwent in 1868, disgusted at the
departure of the Mikado’s government from traditional ideals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
and emboldened by the failure of the French and American
expeditions against her own territory, Corea sent to Tokio
insulting letters, in which she taunted Japan with slavish
truckling to the foreign barbarians, and declared herself an
enemy. This incident, which took place in 1872, rendered
the project of a war with Corea extremely popular in the
Japanese army and navy. Some years, however, were to
elapse before an armed contest took place between the two
countries. In 1875, Mr. Arinori Mori was dispatched to
Pekin, and Kuroda Kiyotaka, at the head of some men-of-war,
entered Corean waters. The twofold diplomatic and
naval demonstration was crowned with success. A treaty
of peace, friendship and commerce was concluded between
Japan and Corea on February 27, 1876. In pursuance of
this treaty, Japan, in 1876, secured the opening of the port
of Fushan to her trade, as compensation for an outrage perpetrated
on some of her sailors. In 1880, Chemulpo, the
port of Seoul, the Corean capital, was also thrown open to
Japanese commerce. The activity of the Japanese gave
umbrage to the court of Pekin, and, in 1881, a draft commercial
treaty was drawn up by the Chinese authorities, in
conjunction with the representatives of the principal Western
powers at the Chinese capital, and carried to Seoul for acceptance
by the American naval officer, Commodore Schufeldt.
The treaty, being recommended by China, was, naturally,
accepted by Corea. When the Japanese, however,
observed that the Chinese were putting forward a pretension
to control exclusively the destinies of the Hermit Kingdom,
they determined to assert their old claim to an equal voice
with China in the Corean peninsula. They allied themselves
with the so-called progressive party in Corea, and
thus forced China to link her fortunes with the reactionists.</p>

<p>Except among the reformers, who constituted but a weak
minority of the Corean population, the Japanese were far
from popular in the Hermit Kingdom, and, in June, 1882,
the reactionists attacked the Japanese Legation, murdered
some of its inmates and compelled the survivors to flee.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
Thereupon, the Japanese sent a force to exact reparation,
while the Chinese, on their part, sent a force to restore
order. A temporary accommodation was effected, but, for
two years, Chinese and Japanese soldiers remained close to
one another under the walls of Seoul. In December, 1884,
a second collision occurred between the Japanese and Coreans,
the latter being aided this time by the Chinese. The
first named were compelled to flee. The Tokio government
obtained reparation for this fresh outrage, but, not
satisfied therewith, it dispatched Count Ito to Pekin to bring
about some permanent arrangement. There is no doubt
that, at this time, the Chinese occupied a much stronger
position in Corea than did the Mikado’s subjects, but the
advantage was thrown away by an agreement which tied
China’s hands and had far-reaching consequences.</p>

<p>Li Hung Chang was appointed Plenipotentiary to negotiate
with Count Ito, and a convention was signed by them
at Tientsin, on April 18, 1885. It provided, first, that both
countries should recall their troops from Corea; secondly,
that no more officers should be sent by either country to drill
Corean soldiers; and, thirdly, that if, at any future time,
either of the parties to the convention should decide to send
a force to Corea, it must straightway inform the other. By
this compact, China acknowledged that Japan’s right to control
Corea was on a level with her own, and it was henceforth
unreasonable for the Pekin authorities to speak of
Corea as a vassal State. For nine years after the conclusion
of the Tientsin Convention, peace prevailed in the Hermit
Kingdom. In the spring of 1894, however, the Tong Haks,
a body of religious reformers, broke into open rebellion, and,
toward the end of May, obtained a considerable success over
the troops of the Corean Government. China was at once
requested to dispatch a force to save the capital, and, by the
10th of June, 2,000 Chinese soldiers were encamped at Asan,
a port some distance to the south of Seoul. A few Chinese
men-of-war were also ordered to cruise off the Corean coasts.
In pursuance of the terms of the Tientsin Convention, notification<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
of the dispatch of these forces to Corea was given to
the Tokio government, which, having had equal rights conceded
to it, was resolved to exercise them with promptitude
and vigor. Within forty-eight hours after the arrival of the
Chinese at Asan, the Japanese had placed a far superior
number of soldiers at Seoul, and of ships at Chemulpo. They
thus secured complete possession of the capital and of the
court, although both had been in thorough sympathy with
China. To avert an insurrection in Seoul, it was thought
needful to secure the person of the King of Corea, and his
palace was, accordingly, captured by the Japanese, and the
ruler of the peninsula converted into their tool or ally. He
was, forthwith, required to put his seal to a document ordering
the Chinese troops, who had come at his invitation, to
leave the country. This seizure of the King’s person took
place on July 23, 1894. Two days later, the Japanese squadron
attacked the transport “Kowshing” and some armed
vessels which were convoying it. In the ensuing engagement,
one Chinese man-of-war was sunk, one was disabled,
and 1,200 soldiers went down with the “Kowshing.” On
the same day, the Japanese General Oshima left Seoul with
a small force to attack the Chinese camp, which had been
transferred from Asan to Song-hwan, a strongly fortified
position. The place was carried on July 29 by a night surprise
with a loss to the Chinese of 500 killed and wounded;
the remainder of the force then retreated to Pingyang, a town
north of Seoul, on the main road to China. These encounters
were followed by a reciprocal declaration of war between
China and Japan on August 1, 1894. There ensued a lull in
hostilities, during which Japan poured her troops into Corea,
while the Chinese fleet remained inactive in the harbors of
Wei-hai-Wei and Port Arthur. About the beginning of
September, a Japanese force of 13,000 men under General
Nodzu was ordered to attack the strong position occupied by
the Chinese at Pingyang. The assault was delivered on May
15, and the Chinese were compelled to retreat with a loss of
2,000 killed, in addition to the wounded and prisoners. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
sturdiness of the defense at certain points was attested by
the fact that the victors themselves lost 633 killed, wounded
and missing. The capture of Pingyang resulted in the
Chinese evacuation of Corea.</p>

<p>While the fighting was taking place on land at Pingyang,
the Chinese fleet, under the command of Admiral Ting, was
conveying troops to the mouth of the Yalu River, the northwestern
boundary of Corea, where the Chinese were collecting
a second army. Returning from the fulfillment of this
task, the fleet was encountered off the island of Hai Yang
on September 17, by a Japanese squadron under Admiral
Ito. The naval combatants were nearly equal in strength,
each numbering ten war vessels; two of the Chinese ships,
however, were superior in armament. The result of the
action was that five of the Chinese torpedo-boats were destroyed,
and the total loss of the Chinese in killed and
wounded was 1,000, while that of the Japanese was but 265.</p>

<p>The Japanese, having been re-enforced by a considerable
body of soldiers under Marshal Yamagata, began their forward
movement from Pingyang early in October, 1894, and
on the 10th of the month reached the Yalu, where they
found a considerable Chinese army posted on the northern
bank of the river. After a merely nominal resistance, however,
the Chinese officers and soldiers abandoned their fortifications
on October 25 and 26, thus allowing the Japanese to
capture an enormous quantity of war materials, including
seventy-four cannon, over 4,000 rifles and more than 4,000,000
rounds of ammunition. While Marshal Yamagata was
forcing the passage of the Yalu, another Japanese army
under Marshal Oyama had landed on the Liau-tung, or
Regent’s Sword peninsula, with the view of assailing the
great naval station of Port Arthur. The natural and artificial
strength of this place was great; over 300 guns were
in position, and the garrison numbered at least 10,000 men,
while the assailants did not exceed 13,000, although, of
course, they were materially aided by their fleet. Having
landed at the mouth of the Hua-yuan River, about 100 miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
north of Port Arthur, the Japanese pushed southward and
captured the well-fortified city of Chinchow without losing a
man. On the next day, they had a similar experience at
Talien-wan, where they found over 120 cannon, 2,500,000
rounds of artillery ammunition, and nearly 34,000,000 rifle
cartridges. On November 22, 1894, the Japanese army and
fleet made a concerted attack upon Port Arthur, and, with
the loss of eighteen men killed and 250 wounded, gained possession
of a naval stronghold on which $20,000,000 had been
spent. During the following month of December, the force
under Marshal Yamagata advanced into Manchuria, but here
they were confronted by a fresh Chinese army, which had
been assembled to defend Mukden, the old Manchu capital,
and which evinced a good deal of courage. In one fight at
Kangwasai, the Japanese experienced a loss of 400 men, and
the subsequent capture of Kaiping cost them 300 killed and
wounded. About the middle of January, 1895, the energies
of the Japanese were turned against the naval fortress of
Wei-hai-Wei, which is situated on the northern coast of Shantung,
opposite Port Arthur, and constitutes, with the last-named
place, the keys of the Gulf of Pechili. After landing,
on January 20, at Yungchang, a little west of the place
to be attacked, the Japanese, six days later, appeared at the
gates of Wei-hai-Wei. The place was defended not only by
a semicircular line of forts and batteries and two fortified
islands in the bay, but also by the Chinese fleet under Admiral
Ting, which comprised nine large vessels, besides six
small gunboats and seven large and four small torpedo-boats.
The attack began on January 29, and continued for three
weeks; nor would Admiral Ting, even then, have consented
to surrender, had he not received a telegraphed message from
Li Hung Chang to the effect that no help need be looked for.
After the terms of surrender were agreed upon, the Chinese
admiral committed suicide. After the fall of Wei-hai-Wei,
the Japanese in Manchuria continued their advance, and
captured the twin city of Newchang, thus placing themselves
between Mukden and the Chinese capital. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
spring was about to open, they possessed an army of 100,000
men, ready to move upon Pekin, and there is no doubt that
they could have taken the city speedily and easily. Two
months previously, the Chinese had sent to Tokio a pretended
peace mission with inadequate powers, but now the
Pekin government, recognizing the impossibility of resistance,
appointed Li Hung Chang plenipotentiary, and dispatched
him to Shimonoseki, which he reached on March 20,
1895. Luckily for the success of his mission, he was shot in
the cheek by a fanatic four days after his arrival, while he
was returning from a conference with Count Ito, the representative
of Japan. This outrage aroused great sympathy
for Li Hung Chang, and, to prove the sincerity of his regret,
the Mikado consented to an armistice, and sensibly modified
the terms of peace upon which he had originally insisted.
On April 17, 1895, the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed,
and, on May 8, the ratifications were exchanged at Chefoo.
The provisions of the treaty may be briefly summed up as
follows: The Chinese were to surrender the islands of Formosa
and the Pescadores, and also, on the Asiatic mainland,
the southern part of the province of Shingking, including the
Regent’s Sword peninsula, and, of course, the naval fortress
of Port Arthur. By way of pecuniary indemnity, China
was to pay 200,000,000 Kuping taels, or, say, $170,000,000,
in eight installments, with interest at the rate of five per
cent on those unpaid. The commercial concessions were to
include the admission of ships under the Japanese flag to the
different rivers and lakes of China and the appointment of
consuls; and the Japanese were to retain Wei-hai-Wei until
the whole indemnity had been paid and an acceptable commercial
treaty had been concluded. These terms were by no
means excessive, in view of the completeness of the Japanese
triumph, but they gave great umbrage to Russia, which foresaw
that the presence of the Japanese on the Regent’s Sword
peninsula would prove an obstacle to its plans of southward
extension through Manchuria, and to the attainment of an
ice-free port. Moreover, had the Japanese been suffered to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
remain on the mainland of Asia, they, instead of the Russians,
would have become preponderant at Pekin. Accordingly,
the Czar’s advisers, having secured the co-operation
not only of their French ally, but also of Germany, proceeded
to make a diplomatic move, the aim of which was to
despoil the Mikado of a part of the fruits of victory. Scarcely
was the ink dry on the Treaty of Shimonoseki, when Japan
received from the three European powers just named a polite
request, which veiled, of course, a threat, that she should
waive that part of the Shimonoseki Treaty which provided
for the cession of Port Arthur and the Liau-tung peninsula.
Japan would doubtless have repelled the demand, had she
been assured of Great Britain’s support. But no assurance
to that effect was forthcoming from Lord Rosebery, then
British Prime Minister, and, accordingly, the Mikado consented
to resign his claim to the Liau-tung peninsula for the
additional indemnity of $30,000,000. The final installment
of the indemnity was paid in May, 1898, whereupon Wei-hai-Wei
was evacuated by the Japanese, and, soon afterward,
was ceded by the Pekin government to Great Britain.</p>

<p>Since the compulsory revision of the Shimonoseki Treaty,
the attitude of the Tokio Foreign Office has been marked by
much reserve and dignity. Japan has employed the years
that have since elapsed, and the money received from China,
in prosecuting extensive military and naval reforms. Nor is
the time distant when, with the warships built at home or
purchased in foreign shipyards, she will have a navy only
second to that possessed by Great Britain in the Far East,
and will be able to place half a million thoroughly trained
and equipped soldiers on the mainland of Asia. In Corea,
she has obtained increased freedom of action, Russia having
practically waived her claims to ascendency in that country;
Japan has turned the opportunity to account by building a
railway from Chemulpo to Seoul, which should materially
help her to maintain control of the Hermit Kingdom. Whatever
may be the Mikado’s ultimate intention, he has, as yet,
given no conclusive proof of a wish to participate in the game<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
of partition now being played in China. No protest came
from him when, toward the close of 1897, Germany seized
the harbor of Kiao Chou, or when, on March 27, 1898, a
convention signed at Pekin gave the Russians the usufruct
of Port Arthur and Talien-wan. In September, however,
the Marquis (formerly Count) Ito was dispatched as a special
embassador to the Chinese capital, for the purpose, as
it is believed, but not positively known, of arranging an alliance
between the Japanese and Chinese empires, which
should put an effectual stop to further encroachments on
the part of Russia. Then occurred the palace revolution at
Pekin, whereby the young Emperor Kwangsu was virtually
dethroned, and the supreme authority usurped by the Empress
Dowager, Tsi An. There being, thenceforward, no
hope of effecting the desired arrangement, the Marquis Ito
returned to Japan, soon after which—namely, on October
31—the homogeneous Ministry which had taken office in
June of this year—the first Ministry of the kind, by the
way, since the establishment of the Constitution in 1889—was
compelled to resign, and was succeeded by an eclectic
cabinet even more thoroughly representative of the Japanese
desire to play a great rôle in the Far East. On November
6, an envoy deputed by the Mikado to present certain gifts
to the Chinese Emperor insisted upon obtaining an audience,
and thus succeeded in discovering that the unfortunate
Kwangsu was still living.</p>

<p>It remains to note that the Tokio Foreign Office has at
last succeeded in inducing the principal Western powers to
abolish the exterritoriality clauses in their respective treaties,
whereby their subjects were exempted from the jurisdiction
of the Japanese tribunals. With the disappearance of these
clauses, which are still exacted not only in the case of China,
Siam, Persia and Morocco, but also in the case of Turkey
and Egypt, the Mikado’s empire may be said to have taken
a recognized place among highly civilized nations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> taken her place as a power on an equality with
the great world-powers, Japan entered upon the Twentieth
Century as the leader of Asiatic nations in introducing modern
civilization. The year 1901, in the Japanese calendar,
was called the Meiji Era, or Period of Enlightened Rule—a
fitting name for the first year of the New Empire in the new
century. The electoral franchise had been extended, in 1900,
to include all excepting certain uneducated persons in the
lowest classes. The country was now divided politically into
fifty Prefectures, Imperial Cities and Territories, in each of
which the people had a voice in the administration. Consistent
with her alliance with the great nations of Christendom,
and with a constitutional government, the Japanese
people now enjoyed, not only representative institutions, but
also local self-government, freedom of the press and of public
meetings, and religious liberty. Behold Twentieth Century
Japan, then, open to any and every religious faith; her
people taking part in the government, and through the Imperial
Diet, a representative body, wielding a direct influence;
the right of petition, assembly, discussion, and publication,
free and open; advocating free and untrammeled education<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>
of her masses; and to the ambitious student lending a helping
hand to the attainment of the highest education.</p>

<p>The Japanese Imperial family, at the dawn of the twentieth
century, had severed its connection with all the impracticable
and æsthetic traditions of 2,600 years; and its
members permitted the people now to look upon their faces,
meeting Japanese subjects face to face, without fear on either
side. Even the Emperor, Mutsuhito, the one hundred and
twenty-second Mikado in direct descent of the dynasty
founded <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 660, is to-day a personage far different from
the Mikado of 1804. Instead of the secluded monarch, whose
face was never seen by his subjects, the Mikado of 1904 appears
in public quite as freely as the King of England or the
President of France. Three times a year he reviews his
troops; he permits foreign visitors to be shown through his
palace; he receives distinguished foreigners in person; he
drives through the streets and parks daily. This monarch,
not by force or by revolution, but voluntarily, surrendered to
the people many of his prerogatives. By the Mikado, in fact,
more than by any statesman or party, Japan was recreated.</p>

<p>As for the Empress, Her Majesty, more than any Japanese
man, is responsible for the changed conditions surrounding
Japanese womanhood. Toward the close of the nineteenth
century she adapted modern ideas to Japanese customs, in so
far as they affected those of her sex. Instead of being a
recluse, a prisoner, virtually a slave, with blackened teeth
and shaved eyebrows, like her predecessor of 1804, the Empress
of 1904 appears frequently in public with her beauty
unimpaired. She encourages, in every practical way, feminine
education. She is a patron of many artistic and philanthropic
enterprises and a member of the International Red
Cross Society. She is beloved by the people for her many
good and charitable deeds. Mainly through the influence of
the Empress, then, the conditions surrounding Japanese
women, with the dawn of the twentieth century, had changed
for the better. Formerly, the Japanese women had no rights
whatsoever. A wife was merely an Oriental chattel—she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
could be sold or divorced as her husband willed. In 1899, however,
rights which her husband was bound to respect, together
with her legal social status, were defined as follows: “A woman
can now become the head of a family and exercise authority
as such; she can inherit and own property and manage it herself;
she can exercise parental authority; she can act as guardian
or executor and has a voice in family councils.”</p>

<p>The Crown Prince of Japan, Yoshihito—Prince of Haru-no-Miya—who
will succeed the present Mikado on the throne,
followed his father and mother in the adoption of Western
ideas and customs. Though he has never traveled outside of
Japan, he has ignored the traditions of his dynasty to an extent
unheard of in any other Oriental country. His attendance
at the Nobles School in Tokio marked the beginning
of the new era in Japanese education. For theretofore the
Imperial Princes were educated privately within the seclusion
of the palace walls. The Crown Prince, however, recited
his lessons with the children of the nobles and joined them
in their games. In May, 1900, the Crown Prince, then in his
twenty-first year, was married at Haru to the second daughter
of Prince Kujo. His bride, Princess Sava-Ko, was then in
her nineteenth year. As the future Empress of Japan, she
is now receiving an education that will fit her for the throne.</p>

<p>To conclude this mention of the Imperial family, it may
be stated that the Shogun, meantime, and all that he represented,
had passed into history. The last of the Tokugawa
dynasty—referred to in a previous chapter—who abdicated
in 1867, was, in 1901, living in retirement in Tokio as a private
citizen, riding a bicycle and otherwise evincing practical
approval of the New Japan that had shouldered aside the Old
Japan.</p>

<p>The new form of government in Japan was declared by
statesmen of the Liberal party to be only semi-democratic.
Enlightened Japanese and students of Japan’s development
asserted that Japan was hampered rather than helped by this
semi-democracy, and affirmed that the new order of things
was a complete disappointment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>“The representative assembly of Japan, so admirably arranged
in theory,” wrote United States Senator Beveridge,
after a close study of the subject, “has more than once proved
to be a vexatious interference with the far-seeing plans of
the empire’s real statesmen. The floors of the Diet have frequently
been made rostrums from which demagogy has
shouted to the masses—a stage upon which candidates for
applause have outscreamed one another in playing the rôle
of parliamentary conspicuity.”</p>

<p>All such criticism of the new form of government was
based on comparison with that of European powers whose
period of development included centuries, while Japan’s
period of advancement covered barely half a century.
Against the “disappointment” of students who had been educated
out of Japan, and of “enlightened Japanese” who had
traveled abroad, stood the satisfaction of the great body of
people, whose source of satisfaction was the comparison of
conditions in their country at the beginning of the twentieth
century with conditions at the opening of the nineteenth century.
Conditions in Japan in the first years of the nineteenth
century are given in detail in previous chapters of this
work. In comparison with those conditions, it is now in order
to give the most important details of conditions one hundred
years later. It must be remarked, first, that all Japan’s
real advance took place during the last third of the nineteenth
century, and that conditions in 1904 were the result, therefore,
of the achievements of a single generation. It is not
recorded in history that any other nation advanced so far in
so short a time.</p>

<p>In 1904, foreigners, instead of being feared, hated, and
excluded from the country, as in 1804, were invited to come
to Japan by the Government itself—to teach in Japanese
universities, to drill the Japanese army and navy, to advise
in matters of administration, and to engage in trade. Thousands
of foreigners, then, of many different nationalities, not
only traveled in Japan, but resided there. On the other
hand, thousands of Japanese subjects were now seen in all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>
parts of the world; many were enrolled as students in European
and American universities; and many were residing
in foreign countries as merchants and traders. In all the
harbors of Japan were seen vessels flying the flags of many
different nationalities; while vessels carrying the Japanese
flag plied regularly between home ports and Asia, America,
Europe, and Australia, conducting freight and passenger
service.</p>

<p>In 1904, too, the classes below the nobility had been
minimized to two—namely, the gentry and the commons.
Even in these two classes the distinction was nominal. Only
in official records, in the exercise of the elective franchise
and on certain other occasions, were the people required to
register their grade in the social or political scale. Aside
from the nobility, caste had disappeared. Merit, not rank,
was rewarded in public life; while in private life claim to respect
lay in achievement and education rather than in one’s
standing as to class.</p>

<p>In education, a suggestion of the broadening process in
this field—from the mere study of the Japanese and Chinese
classics—is contained in the statement that one college in
Tokio, in its desire to attract students, took the name “College
of One Hundred Branches.” Studies in Japan now include
all Occidental as well as all Oriental branches. With
the spread of education, with the learning of languages, came
foreign books. The study of the English language had been
made compulsory in all schools, and with the advent of the
twentieth century thousands of students had learned also
French, German, Spanish, Dutch, Russian, and Italian.
Books in all these languages were imported, and libraries
throughout Japan now contained as many books in foreign
languages as in Japanese. The dead languages, too—Greek,
Latin, Hebrew, and Sanskrit—had become part of the curriculum
of nearly all schools and colleges. Formerly, only
nobles, priests, and those of the military classes received an
education. Now elementary education was free for all, the
American school system, with certain modifications, having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>
been put into effect throughout the Empire. Books in many
different foreign languages were also now printed within the
Empire, in printing-offices equipped with modern type,
presses, and appliances. A large number of magazines were
published in Tokio and Yokohama, and almost every town
had its local newspaper.</p>

<p>In religion, Japan in 1904 still remained a Buddhist
country, yet Christianity had 125,000 enrolled believers.
With religious freedom came Christian ministers, who built
Christian churches which were openly attended by Christian
converts, while a gospel ship cruised in the Inland Sea, seeking
converts among Japanese sailormen and fishermen.</p>

<p>Japan began the twentieth century with a system of law
and legal administration based on European models. The
criminal law, for example, was based on the Code Napoleon.
Trial by jury, however, had not yet been adopted. There
were four courts—namely, Local, District, Appellate, and
Supreme. The judges were appointed by the Emperor and
held office for life or during good behavior. Certain foreigners
claimed at this time that a European citizen stood
small chance of receiving justice in a Japanese court. To refute
these charges a Yokohama newspaper, the “Japan Mail,”
made an examination of the courts there covering a period of
six years, with the following result: Ninety-six cases brought
by Europeans. In eight a judgment partly in favor of each
party; compromised and settled thirty-eight. Out of the remaining
fifty, thirty-six were decided in favor of the foreign
plaintiff and fourteen in favor of the Japanese defendant.
These facts show that foreigners were treated fairly in, at
least, the courts of Yokohama.</p>

<p>In the world’s commerce, Japan at the beginning of the
nineteenth century played so small a part that no record was
kept of her exports or her imports. In the first year of the
twentieth century, the figures for Japan’s commerce showed
$130,000,000 for exports and $140,000,000 for imports.
At this time, next to the soldier, the merchant was
the most important factor in Japanese society and civilization.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
Formerly despised for trading for profit, the Japanese
merchant class now represented the complete change from
feudal and æsthetic Japan to commercial and democratic
Japan. The sword and the barracks were still first in Japanese
esteem, but the next highest honors belonged to the ledger
and the business office. Behind her new commerce lay Japan’s
newly developed manufacturing industries. In the gardens
of the Prince of Mito in Tokio was built a national arsenal.
And all over the Empire, Japanese makers of things had
built an immense number of manufacturing plants—engine
works, electrical apparatus manufactories, cotton, woolen,
and paper mills, and iron foundries, dockyards, and shipyards.</p>

<p>As for modern means of communication, Japan began
the present century with four thousand miles of railway, ten
thousand miles of telegraph, and, in the Japanese capital
city alone, sixty-five hundred telephones. Telegraph and
telephone bureaus in the Mikado’s palace placed the Emperor
in direct communication with his entire Empire and with
the whole world. The jinrikisha remained the most popular
local conveyance, principally because Japan lacked horses.
But there were also horse-cars, stages, a few horses, and some
carriages, trolley-cars, and bicycles. In 1904, an electric
railway had even invaded Kyoto, once sacred to the Mikado.
Trolley-cars even ran through the ancient domains of Shogun
and Emperor, where once the peasant who even unwittingly
stepped foot was arrested and ultimately beheaded.</p>

<p>In the three great necessities—food, clothing, and shelter—Japan
began the twentieth century with a modern bill of
fare, with European dress, and with houses built and furnished
to some extent in Western fashion. Once a nation of
vegetarians, the Japanese diet now included anything and
everything to eat and drink known in Europe. Many families
employed foreign cooks, and great numbers of the common
people ate foreign food at least once a day. In 1904,
the Empress of Japan received foreign visitors dressed precisely
as were dressed the European women in Tokio; that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>
is to say, in the latest Parisian gowns, with the addition of
the latest Parisian millinery. The Emperor, too, abandoned
the kimono for trousers and frock coat; at least on public
occasions. In short, European clothes were as common a
sight in the streets of the greater cities as native costumes,
though in the rural districts the people still adhered strictly
to the costumes of their forefathers. In the matter of
houses, the influence of foreign architecture was, in 1904,
just beginning to be perceptible. Not that dwelling-houses
were built European style, but that Japanese architecture
had become somewhat modified by foreign architecture.
Brick and stone were replacing wood in the construction of
residences, stores, and offices. Paper in doors and windows
was giving way to glass; matting for floors was being replaced
by rugs. And in rooms where formerly there was
not one article of furniture—rooms in which the family sat
and slept and ate on the floor—there were now European
chairs, bedsteads, and tables. Where once the only light in
the house was furnished by a pith-wick floating in vegetable
oil, or by lightning-bugs imprisoned in a bamboo-cage, there
were now lamps filled with oil from Russia or America, and,
in the cities, gas and electric lights.</p>

<p>One class alone, in all Japan at the beginning of the
present century, was still of the Japan of old. This was
the agricultural class. Agriculture was still the chief pursuit
of the common people. The soil, of volcanic origin, was
liberally fertilized, and yielded immense harvests. The
farms were small, exceeding in few cases more than fifteen
acres. Upon these few acres, however, a Japanese peasant
supported himself and his family, and even had something
left over after paying his tax-bills. The chief products for
export were rice, tea, and silk. It was in the <i>method</i> that
farming remained the same as in years gone by. Very few
farmers owned horses; in general, the farmers broke the
ground with a spade and cultivated it with a hoe. Of this
class a traveler has said: “Left to the soil to till it, to live
and die upon it, the Japanese farmer has remained the same—with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>
his horizon bounded by his rice fields, his water
courses, or the timbered hills, his intellect laid away for safe
keeping in the priest’s hands—caring little who rules him, unless
he is taxed beyond the power of flesh and blood to bear.”</p>

<p>In the first quarter of the twentieth century, the Japanese
promised to make of their country that which they called
Greater Japan. Public opinion, in 1904, regarding Japan’s
immediate future, as summed up by Japanese statesmen and
by Japanese publicists, was as follows: “Japan is especially
favored by nature with beauty and picturesqueness of scenery
and a healthful climate, and has been appropriately called
the ‘Paradise of the East.’ We shall turn this country into
a grand park of the nations, and draw pleasure-seekers from
all parts of the world. We shall build magnificent hotels
and establish excellent clubs, in most splendid style, to receive
the royal visitors of Europe and the millionaires of
America.</p>

<p>“To all appearances, the seas about Japan and China
will be the future theatre of the Far East. The Philippines
have been reduced to a province of the United States. China,
separated from us only by a very narrow strip of water, is
offering every promise of becoming a great resource open to
the world of the twentieth century. The Siberia railway has
been opened to traffic; and the construction of a canal across
Central America is expected to be finished before long....
As for fuel, our supply of coal from the mines of Hokkaido
and Kiushiu is so abundant that the surplus, not required
for our own consumption, is exported largely into various
parts of the East, where no productive coal mines have been
found except a very few ones of poor quality....</p>

<p>“Taking all these things into account, it is not too much
to say that the future situation of Japan will be that of a
central station of various water passages—a situation most
conducive to the good of our country; and that, numerous as
the attractive places of historical interest and natural beauty
are, it is chiefly from our excellently advantageous position—a
connecting link common to the three chains of water passage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>
to and from Europe, America, and Asia—that we shall
be able to obtain the largest share of the riches of the nations
of the world.”</p>

<p>In the story of Japan’s interests and influence in Asia,
in which are involved the events that led to the war with
Russia, we will first explain the relationship of Japan to
Asia from the Japanese viewpoint. The substance of the
Japanese idea at this time was that the Japanese people regarded
themselves as the natural leaders in all Asiatic countries
in the introduction of modern civilization. The Japanese
agreed that the Chinese and Coreans, for example,
could learn about civilization much faster and easier from
Japan than from the countries in Europe and America, for
they had a common system of letters, and to a certain extent
common ideas. A Japanese professor is reported as saying:
“It is the mission of Japan to set up an example of a civilized
and independent national state for her Asiatic neighbors,
and then to make a confederation of all the Asiatic nations
on the basis of international law; just as it is the mission of
the United States of America to form one vast pan-American
Union of all the republics of the new hemisphere, and thus
to hasten on the progress toward the organization of the whole
world.”</p>

<p>Supplementing which a Japanese editor is quoted as follows:
“It is our duty to transmit the essence of Occidental
civilization to our neighbors, as better success may be realized
by so doing than by introducing there the new institutions
directly from the West. The present state of things in
China does not allow her to appreciate fully the ideas of
Westerners, more so because their fundamental conception
of morals is at variance with that of Occidentals. But Japan
has every facility to win the confidence of China, in consideration
of its geographical situation and of its literary affinity.
The valor, discipline, and order of our army have already
gained the confidence and respect of the Chinese, and
it now remains for us to guide them to higher possibilities
with enlightened thoughts and ideas. Such a work can not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>
be accomplished in a day; it will require years of perseverance
and toil.”</p>

<p>After this citation of what the Japanese deemed to be
their mission and duty in Asia, let us see what Japan has
accomplished in Asiatic territory already acquired. Formosa,
as stated in the foregoing chapter, was ceded to Japan by
China after the Chino-Japanese War. In the first eight
years under Japanese rule, the revenue of the new territory
increased many hundred per cent—from $1,500,000 in
1896 to $12,000,000 in 1903. In 1897, Japan took a complete
census of the population, built 800 miles of roads and
constructed a tramway line from Takow to Sintek. This
was followed by the construction of a main line of railway
between principal cities, which now, in 1904, is open to passenger
and freight traffic. Japan also laid down three cables
connecting Formosa with Japan, Foo Chow, and the
Pesadores. In the interior of Formosa, Japan has since
established a complete system of intercommunication by
means of 1,500 miles of telegraph and telephone wires.
She has opened over a hundred post-offices in Formosa, and
letters can now be sent to any part of the Empire for two
cents each. She has established nearly one hundred and
fifty Government educational institutions in Formosa, only
a few of these being for Japanese, leaving the majority
for natives. Japan has now twelve great Government hospitals
on the island, at which more than 70,000 patients
are treated without charge every year. Japan has also
given considerable attention to Formosa in the matter of
free vaccination and general sanitary precautions, and has
consequently greatly reduced the danger from the frequent
outbreaks of smallpox and the plague. When the Japanese
first took possession of Formosa in 1895, the people
rose in rebellion against their new rulers. By 1904, however,
Japan had restored peace throughout the island, a
settled government had assumed full control and the island’s
resources were being developed to their fullest extent.</p>

<p>Now to glance at Japan’s influence in Asiatic countries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span>
not under Japanese rule. First of all, Siam. The Siamese
Crown Prince, for example, after a visit to Japan, caused
a Japanese building to be constructed for himself, while the
King ordered a Japanese house and garden to be added to
his palace grounds. Japan is in many ways, indeed, the
teacher and leader of the Siamese. She sends teachers to
Siam, and many Siamese boys and girls, on the other hand,
are enrolled in schools in Japan. Japan also sends seeds of
raw materials to be grown in Siam, for to Japan Siam
has ever represented a source of food supply which would
remain neutral in war-time. In 1904, Japan reaped the
benefit from all such influence and teaching and seed supply;
for in that year, with the beginning of the Russo-Japanese
War, Japan was able to depend upon Siam for vast reserves
in food supplies.</p>

<p>In China, the interest of the Japanese, after the Chino-Japanese
War, multiplied year by year. In 1897, a Japanese
consulate was established at Foo Chow. In that year
there were only eight Japanese residents in Foo Chow; in
1904, the number has increased to three hundred, including
natives of Formosa who have become naturalized Japanese.
In Amoy, because of its position directly opposite northern
Formosa, the Japanese have large interests. Further, on
the Yangtse River, there are Japanese lines of passenger
steamers, Japanese steamers for the iron and coal trade, and
other Japanese enterprises.</p>

<p>“Side by side with this development of carrying facilities,”
says a traveler, “many Japanese, in the capacity of merchants,
Government employees or projectors, may be seen
traveling in the Yangtse Valley; and further the number
of persons engaged in the translation of Japanese books
into Chinese has increased in an extraordinary degree....
Nothing is more remarkable than the popularity enjoyed
by Japanese things and Japanese subjects in China.”</p>

<p>The facts just mentioned typify the growing influence of
Japan in China at the time of the outbreak of the Boxer
Insurrection in 1900. It should first be mentioned that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span>
1900 a General Missionary Conference, attended by delegates
from many branches of the Protestant and Catholic
Churches, was held in Tokio. In that same year, when
Christianity was still sending missionaries to Japan to convert
the Buddhists, behold the “heathen” nation allied with
the armies of Christendom in a suppression of the Boxer
Movement in the Chinese Empire. During that troublous
year, the Japanese not only helped to rescue Christian missionaries
and Chinese converts from the fury of mobs and
an uncontrolled soldiery, but those whom they had thus
saved were transported free of charge to Japan and there
given comfortable refuge until it was safe to return
to China. The principal distinct events of historical
interest marking Japan’s connection with the suppression
of the Boxer uprising were as follows: On June 11, the
Chancellor of the Japanese Legation at Pekin was murdered
by a Chinese mob. On June 17, the Japanese troops, with
the allied armies, captured the forts at Taku. On July
13-14, the Japanese, again with the allies, took Tien-tsin
by storm. On August 14, the Japanese, this time with the
divisions of the allied armies destined for the relief of Legations
and foreign residents, entered Pekin. September
found the Japanese doing their full share in policing the
disturbed districts. The Boxer Movement soon after came
to an end, and the Chinese Imperial Court—which fled from
Pekin at the beginning of the trouble—now returned to the
capital. Altogether, in quelling the disturbances which had
shocked the world, and particularly in raising the siege of
Pekin, the Japanese played a brave and conspicuous part
which, more than any of their previous military triumphs,
helped to establish their right to a place on an equal footing
among the world-powers.</p>

<p>In 1901, only twelve months after the events just narrated,
Japan’s trade in North China, especially in Manchuria,
had increased more than in the twelve years previous
to the Boxer uprising. In 1903, Japanese trade with Newchwang
alone amounted to $8,000,000 and her trade with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span>
all Manchuria to $12,000,000. And, from a commercial
viewpoint, other parts of China as well as Manchuria had
become of great importance to Japan. A partial summary
of her achievements in the Chinese Empire at the beginning
of 1904, by peaceable invasion, by the introduction of
modern ideas and educational institutions, as given in
the “Chinese Recorder,” includes the following:</p>

<p>“1. The Agricultural College, established some years ago
at Wuchang by the Viceroy Chang Chih-tung, and managed
for some time by an expert American, has now been given
over to Japanese management.</p>

<p>“2. The military school in Hangchau is taught wholly by
Japanese.</p>

<p>“3. A large amount of translation work is done by the
Japanese.</p>

<p>“4. Many Chinese students have been sent by Chang
Chih-tung during recent years to be educated in Japanese
schools for Chinese Government service.</p>

<p>“5. Influential Chinese newspapers, owned by Japanese,
and advocating closer union between the two countries.</p>

<p>“6. One hundred Japanese students enrolled in the
schools at Shanghai, studying Chinese and English.</p>

<p>“7. Formation of societies of Japanese in China to push
the circulation in China of books on Western learning.”</p>

<p>At this time, then, every Japanese subject employed in
China, in whatever capacity, “was a centre diffusing the light
of liberalism.” The Chinese themselves acknowledged that
they were led along their new path by the Japanese, who
“have some degree of distant kinship with the Chinese.”
That Japan was doing her duty in the way of helping China
to the benefits of material civilization, that Japan was exerting
her influence in China for good on high planes, is
shown in the words of the most eminent Chinese scholar in
America, Dr. Hirth, professor of Chinese in Columbia University,
New York City. Said he: “No capable observer
of events in China since the Imperial Court returned to
Pekin can doubt that the Government has decided to adopt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>
the policy of Japan, which is to take the methods of Western
civilization for their models. In directing the new movement
in China, Japan is taking the lead over other foreign
nations, and this, it is asserted, is due to her superior command
of the language.</p>

<p>“Moreover, every educated Japanese is imbued with the
ideas prevalent in Chinese literature, religious and political,
and hence he has a different standing in the eyes of the Chinese
from that of Americans and Europeans. China has
thus placed the work of educating the rising generation in
the hands of the Japanese as being less likely to destroy the
old knowledge while familiarizing the students with the advantages
of the new.</p>

<p>“A National university has been established by the Emperor
at Pekin, which it is calculated will be the model for
educational institutions all over the country. Recently a
Japanese professor has been selected to draft a new code of
laws for the Empire. The reason why a Japanese was selected
for this work in preference to an equally learned German,
American, or Englishman, is because men who are both
willing and capable of making due allowance for traditional
prejudices will never arise from a country where the study
of Chinese institutions is so much in its infancy as with all
of us, except Japan.”</p>

<p>After the above consideration of Japan’s leadership in
Formosa, Siam, and China, including Manchuria, there remain
the facts relating to Japan’s most important interests
in Corea. In the latter country, Japanese influence, at the
beginning of 1904, was felt even more widely and more potently
than in any other part of Asia. In Corea, on January 1,
1904, there were more than twenty thousand Japanese
subjects. These managed practically all the important commercial
and educational enterprises in the kingdom. By
far the largest part of Corea’s foreign trade—with respect
to both imports and exports—was with Japan. Corea sent
agricultural products to Japan, and imported Japanese manufactured
goods. Japan also virtually controlled Corea’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>
means of communication with foreign countries; for the
postal and telegraph offices in every open port in the kingdom
were in the hands of the Japanese. All Corea’s coasting
trade, also, was carried on by Japanese vessels; for Corea
herself had only an insignificant merchant marine. Practically
all the railways were controlled by the Japanese who
had built them. Every bank of good standing was managed
by Japanese. The fisheries and mining industries were conducted
almost entirely by subjects of the Mikado. Altogether,
all the greatest business enterprises, of whatsoever
nature throughout the kingdom, were conducted by the Japanese.
In short, the Japanese represented the employers of
Corea, while the subjects of the Corean king composed the
great body of employees.</p>

<p>So great were Japanese interests in China and Corea, that
the question of the integrity of those countries, with “open
doors,” had become of vital importance to the Island Empire.
To secure both integrity and “open doors,” Japan utilized
the full power of her diplomatic genius to obtain an alliance
with Great Britain. Her endeavors in this direction
were highly successful. On February 12, 1902, was formed
the historical Anglo-Japanese Alliance to preserve the integrity
of China and the independence of Corea. What led to
this greatest political event in 1902? this first alliance
in history between a white nation and a yellow nation?
What induced England to abandon her traditional policy of
“splendid isolation”? Why did England break that policy
for the first time in many decades to ally herself with an
Oriental rather than an Occidental power? It is to be noted
here that Japan at this time called herself the England of
the East, one historian—Diosy—referring to the matter thus:
“Japan, geographically to the mighty continent of Asia what
Great Britain is to the continent of Europe; Japan, an island
people with all the strength, mental and physical, that is the
heritage of a nation cradled on the sea; Japan, by the necessities
of her environment compelled to appreciate the importance
of sea-power; Japan, in short, the Britain of the Orient.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>Japan’s first opportunity to back up this view of herself,
by concrete demonstration, was furnished by the Boxer Movement
in China. Even then, in 1900, Japan had in mind an
alliance with Great Britain; and now she determined to make
the best possible showing. So thoroughly, accordingly, did
she display her military and naval efficiency, so repeatedly
did her troops win laurels side by side with European
troops, that England was greatly impressed. It was by her
triumph during the Boxer uprising, indeed, that Japan confirmed
her claim to recognition as a world power—a claim
recognized by the powers in 1899, but not reaching full completion
until the signing of the Anglo-Japanese Convention
in 1902.</p>

<p>Second, the alliance was said to be the result of a natural
community of British and Japanese interests in the East;
that the two countries were now allies in fact, while formerly
they had only been allies in spirit; that Japan and England
had similar sympathies and similar policies in the East;
and that therefore the convention was entirely voluntary,
spontaneous, and natural.</p>

<p>Third, the alliance was popularly supposed to include the
two greatest naval powers in the world, and as such it was
said to represent a guarantee of peace in the Orient, and of
fairness in all matters relating to China and Corea. A Japanese
official, in his exaltation, said: “There is no power or
combination of powers that could make head against this
union in the Far East; the attempt would be like spitting
at a tiger.”</p>

<p>The signing of the convention met with popular disapproval
in England; but it was the occasion of great rejoicing
in Japan. In every province in the Mikado’s empire feasts
were held, the celebration being continued over a period of
ten days.</p>

<p>One significant phase of public opinion regarding the
alliance, was that to all intents and purposes it would include
the United States as a “silent partner.” An American historian,
Ernest W. Clement, in his “Hand Book of Modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span>
Japan,” wrote: “It is well known that the convention was
shown at Washington before it was promulgated, and that it
was heartily approved by our Government. Practically,
therefore, it is, in a very broad sense, an Anglo-Japanese Alliance.
Certainly our interests in the Far East have been
and are identical with those of Great Britain and Japan; and
all our ‘moral influence,’ at least, should be exerted toward
the purposes of that convention. Indeed, the Anglo-Japanese
Alliance should mean the union of Great Britain and
the United States with Japan to maintain in the Orient the
‘open door,’ not merely of trade and commerce, but of all
social, intellectual, moral, and religious reforms; the open
door, not of material civilization only, but also of the gospel
of Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p>It was natural that Japan should be eager for American
assistance. When events foretold the coming war between
Russia and Japan, the influence of the United States in international
councils was so great that, as an ally, she would
have been welcomed by Japan, of course. Until the exact
position which the United States would take in regard to
affairs in the Far East was known Japan was nervous; for
Japan understood that the policy of Great Britain as well as
that of France and Germany would be governed to some extent
by that of America. As a government, however, the
government would take no part in the coming war, principally
because the government, for the present, at least, could
not see wherein American interests would be threatened.
However, Japan asked the question pointblank: Would the
United States assist Japan? The answer was an emphatic
but courteous “No.”</p>

<p>With the signing of the Anglo-Japanese Convention began
the seventh great period in the Japan of the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries—the period of Cosmopolitanism.
Japan was no longer native Japan, or Asiatic Japan; she was
now Cosmopolitan Japan. The sixth previous periods were:</p>

<p>I. Seclusion (1801-1853). II. Treaty-making (1854-1858).
III. Civil Commotions (1858-1868). IV. Reconstruction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span>
(1868-1878). V. Internal Development (1879-1889).
VI. Constitutional Government (1889-1904).</p>

<p>The Anglo-Japanese Alliance was presumably a proof
that both the nations signing the convention regarded the
presence of Russian troops in Manchuria and Russian aggression
in the East generally as a genuine, threatening, and
immediate source of danger—danger to British and Japanese
trade. The facts concerning Russia’s interference with
Japan were these: The Russian military forces which were
stationed throughout Manchuria, in 1900, to suppress the
Boxer Movement, had remained on Manchurian soil. In
1901, Japan and other European powers began pressing the
Pekin Government to order the Russian forces out of Manchuria.
Finally, on April 8, 1902, Russia and China signed
a convention at Pekin, wherein Russia agreed to evacuate
Manchuria by the 8th of October. In the meantime, however,
through astute diplomatic procedure on the part of Russia,
the Convention of April 8th “lapsed,” and on October
8th, consequently, there was as great a number of Russian
troops in Manchuria as on April 8th. It was the “lapse” of
the Convention of April 8th that aroused the Japanese nation
to the fact that she would have to deal sternly with Russia;
else Russia, secure in Manchuria, would assume a like position
in Corea, and thus prepare the way for Russian armed
invasion of Japan. A Japanese statesman referred to Corea
at this time as “an arrow with the point aimed at our heart.”
“The absorption of Manchuria by the Russians,” continued
the statesman, “renders the position of Corea precarious.
Corea is life or death to Japan. For the safety of my country
I insist that it shall become Japanese, and upon that insistence
every subject of the Mikado is willing to lay down
his life.”</p>

<p>Corea represented for Japan, indeed, a territorial outlet
for her already congested population. Still further, Japan
feared for her enormous material interest in Corea—her
railways, banks, and trade, already mentioned. Russia’s interest
in Corea, at the same time, lay in the fact that in Corea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span>
as in Manchuria, were ice-free ports, or doors for the great
cage called the Russian Empire. With the Russians in Manchuria,
Japan’s vast interests in Corea were believed to be so
seriously imperiled that Japanese diplomats in St. Petersburg
were ordered to insist to the end upon the evacuation
by the Russians of Manchuria.</p>

<p>To all the representations of the Japanese Government,
the Russian Government gave no heed, but proceeded with
her railroad construction and her colonization in Manchuria,
regardless of Japanese protestation. On May 8, 1903, the
largest Russian force that had entered China since 1900 occupied
the province of Newchwang, Manchuria. And on October
29, 1903, the Russian troops entered Mukden, Manchuria,
and established there a military base. From that day
onward, both countries understood that war was inevitable,
both sides prepared for the conflict. In the coming struggle
Russia counted upon the assistance, if needed, of France,
with whom she had formed an alliance similar to that of
Japan’s with England.</p>

<p>On the 1st of February, 1904, the prolonged tension between
the two countries reached a climax. Diplomatic notes
had been exchanged in vain; diplomacy had done all it could.
At a Cabinet conference in Tokio, hope of peace was practically
abandoned, for the reason that while Russia was unreasonably
delaying her reply to the last Japanese note, she was
daily increasing her warlike activities. When this long-awaited
Russian document was sent to the Russian Minister
at Tokio, it was never delivered. It was known in advance
that Russia partly conceded the demand of Japan in Corea,
but would not place herself on record as recognizing the sovereignty
of China in Manchuria. Nor would Russia even
discuss these questions with Japan. On Saturday, February
6th, at four o’clock in the afternoon, M. Kurino, the Japanese
Minister at St. Petersburg, called personally to inform
the Russian Government that in view of the futility of negotiations
Japan deemed it useless to continue diplomatic relations,
and that Japan would take such steps as she deemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span>
proper for the protection of her interests. Thereupon M.
Kurino asked for his passports. A few hours later the Russian
Minister to Japan prepared to leave the Island Empire.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours later, forty Japanese transports were
loaded with troops to be landed at various points in Corea.
A naval division sailed from Japanese waters for Chemulpo
and another for Port Arthur, and the first landing force was
disembarked at Masanpo, Corea. It was to be a war for mastery
on the Continental shore of Asia, and Japan invited
the war with open defiance.</p>

<p>Before beginning the story of hostilities, it may be well
to give the facts concerning Japan’s naval and military
strength. Her naval strength had for several years been
such that European nations marveled. Joseph Chamberlain,
England’s Colonial Secretary, had said of Japan’s navy:
“Any foreign power that should venture to attack Japan in
her own waters would be strangely advised.” With her splendidly
equipped arsenals and dockyards, with her abundant
supply of coal, with the number and fighting strength of her
ships, with the proved efficiency of her naval officers, with
her perfection of naval organization, with the <i>esprit de corps</i>
of the personnel of her navy—Japan at the beginning of
1904 was indeed a naval power which any European country
might respect. Of this naval power Arthur Diosy, in the
“New Far East,” said: “Japan possesses all the elements of
sea-power: swift, powerful ships, adapted to the work they
are intended for, numerous good harbors, excellent coal in
abundance, capital facilities for the repair of her vessels,
and the necessary plant, constantly augmented and improved,
for building new ones. Her naval organization is wise and
efficient, her administrative services are thorough and honest;
her naval officers are gallant, dashing, and scientifically
trained, and the armament they control is of the latest and
best pattern. Strong in ships, strong in guns, Japan is
stronger still in the factor without which ships and guns are
useless—‘the Man behind the Gun.’”</p>

<p>As for her military strength, Japan’s army was conceded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span>
by military authorities to be the finest “land fighting machine”
east of Germany. “Their tactics,” wrote Senator
Beveridge, in his “Russian Advance,” “are almost wholly
German, even to the artificial and exhausting ‘goose step’ on
parade. Indeed, the Japanese army is a perfect machine,
built on the German model, but perfected at minute points
and in exquisite detail with the peculiar ability of the Japanese
for diminutive accuracy and completeness. The Japanese
army, regiment, company, is ‘built like a watch,’ and
each Japanese soldier is a part of this machine, like a screw
or spring or disk, with this exception—every soldier is capable
of being transformed into another part of this complex
yet simple mechanism.”</p>

<p>At midnight, Monday, February 8, the first shot in the
war was fired. Waiving entirely the formality of a declaration
of war, Japan ordered her finest fleet, under Admiral
Togo, to Port Arthur. There, in the outer harbor, the fleet
suddenly appeared and sent in a flotilla of torpedo-boats to
attack the Russian warships which lay at anchor under
the guns of the forts. For this unexpected attack the Russians
were ill-prepared. Many of the officers of the ships
were ashore at places of amusement. None of the Russian
ships was even stripped for action. With the onslaught
of the torpedo-boats, therefore, the Russian fleet, under
Admiral Stark, was thrown into the utmost confusion. Defeat
ensued. Two Russian first-class battleships were
torpedoed and beached, and a Russian cruiser was torpedoed
and sunk. The Japanese torpedo-boats escaped unharmed.
In this attack, the Russians reported two men killed and thirteen
wounded. The Japanese reported no losses.</p>

<p>Russia at the time claimed treachery on the part of
Japan for attacking her ships prior to a declaration of war.
Experts on international law, however, agreed that under circumstances
such as then existed either nation might attack
as Japan did. All diplomatic relations had ceased, affairs
had reached an acute stage, each country was preparing for
war, and the experts declared that it was unnecessary for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span>
either country to await a declaration of war before striking
the blow.</p>

<p>The next day, February 9, the Japanese fleet of sixteen
vessels returned to Port Arthur and opened a bombardment
on the Russian ships and forts. The Russian return-fire
was ineffectual. During this bombardment one Russian battleship
and three cruisers were damaged below the water
line. The Russian commanders also reported two officers
and fifty-one men wounded, and nine killed.</p>

<p>That same day, February 9, a division of the Japanese
fleet consisting of three cruisers, four gunboats, and eight
torpedo craft, under the command of Admiral Uriu, approached
the harbor of Chemulpo, Corea. Two Russian cruisers,
one of them the <i>Variag</i>, of the first class, the other an
inconsiderable fighting unit, the <i>Korietz</i>, were given until
noon to come out of the neutral port. In the harbor were
French, British, Italian, and American cruisers, whose crews
cheered the craft to sea like the crowds at a football game.
Four miles out the battle began. The Russians were smothered
by weight of metal, and after being crippled and set on
fire, crawled back to the harbor where they blew up and sank.
The <i>Variag</i> lost 30 men and 7 officers killed and 42 wounded,
while the Japanese reported no losses.</p>

<p>Altogether in these first engagements of the war, ten Russian
ships were put out of action, while the Japanese vessels
suffered little damage and reported no loss of life. The
best ships of the Russian fleet were now out of the problem
of attack against Japan; and Japan felt free to pour her
troops into Corea.</p>

<p>Admiral Togo, however, continued to blockade and harass
Port Arthur, at the same time sending a small squadron to
hover off Vladivostok, and hold in check the Russian cruisers
there. The Japanese control of the sea was so complete by
this time that preparations were made to resume the mail
steamer service between Shanghai and Japanese ports without
convoy, and to return several of the liners, which had
been taken as auxiliary cruisers, to their regular runs across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span>
the Pacific and to Australia. Such were, in brief, the naval
operations during the first month of the war.</p>

<p>The land operations of the same period included no engagements
that might be called battles. The Japanese landed
twenty thousand men on Russian territory, south of Vladivostok;
and a similar number of men had been landed on the
east coast of Corea. Thus Japan began a flank movement,
whose objective was the isolation of Vladivostok; while at
the same time other troops advanced toward Harbin, in Manchuria,
where the Russians occupied a strategic position.
During this time the Russian and Japanese outposts clashed
repeatedly near Ping-yang in northern Corea. On March
1st, the Japanese General Staff left Japan for Corea, and a
few days later the landing and the mobilization of the Japanese
army in Corea was complete.</p>

<p>In the first week in March, Japan announced that a
treaty had been made with Corea which recognized the entity
of that kingdom, included guarantees against absorption by
Japan or Russia, and virtually established a protectorate,
such as England held in Egypt. Corea became an ally of
Japan by the terms of this treaty.</p>

<p>At the end of the first month of the war both combatants
had settled down to the most thorough preliminary campaign,
for the establishment of bases and lines of communication,
before their armies swung into battle line. Such was the
war situation in the Far East in March, 1904, when throughout
the world it was feared that the Russo-Japanese War
would end in a world war, or in a conflict involving, at least,
Japan’s ally, England, and Russia’s ally, France. Friends
of the Japanese put the matter thus: “Russia and Japan
can not both breathe freely in the Orient. One or the other
must be cramped in opportunity and warped in development.
Each is acting upon the law of self-preservation, not as a pretext,
but as an immediate, pressing necessity. If Russia
wins, Europe becomes rapidly more like Asia. If Japan is
the victor, the continent of so many glories may have a future
of its own.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the striking of the first blows to check Russia’s
advance, Japan at once became master of the situation in the
Far East and remained master till the end of the war through
repeated victories on land and sea. Japanese progress and
expansion had been imperiled by Russia’s occupation of
Manchuria and by Russian aggression in Corea, these two
countries being the very territory needed by Japan for her
overflowing population. Therefore, behind national pride in
the splendid achievements of the Japanese army and navy,
was national instinct of self-preservation. Corea and Manchuria
were to Japan national necessities; and so Japan began
ridding herself of the menace of Russia in territory that
the Japanese regarded as being logically their own sphere of
influence. Japan won; and, by reason of victory, became a
world power, to dominate in the East for years to come.</p>

<p>The last week of February, 1904, found General Kuroki,
commanding the Japanese First Army in the East, with his
forces concentrated along the Yalu River that separates Corea
from Manchuria. General Kuroki had already occupied
Ping Yang, and now was ready to begin the forward movement
against the Russian army under General Kuropatkin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span>March and April witnessed the steady advance of the
Japanese First Army, Kuroki having crossed the Yalu River
with three divisions to attack divisions of Kuropatkin’s army
under General Sassulitch and others. On May 1st, the first
serious blow was struck, at Kiu-lien-cheng, when Kuroki
drove the Russians out of that place. The Japanese immediately
followed up this victory with another—driving the
Russians from their position north of Kiu-lien-cheng, to
which they had retreated. The losses in these two engagements
were (officially) 2,397 officers and men of the Russian
forces; and (unofficially) 800 officers and men of the Japanese
army.</p>

<p>On May 7th, Kuroki captured another town, Feng-wang-cheng,
the Russians retreating without giving battle. The
first setback to the Japanese in the war came with defeat in
an engagement with Cossacks north of Feng-wang-cheng,
May 18th.</p>

<p>Eight days later (May 26), however, the almost monotonous
succession of victories that characterized the movement
of the Japanese armies throughout the war was resumed
with a victory at the great battle of Kinchow and Nanchan
Hill. This was the first really notable pitched battle of the
war. After sixteen hours of continuous fighting, the Russians
began a precipitous retreat, pursued by the Japanese.</p>

<p>The casualties on both sides were very heavy, those of
Japan being estimated at between 3,500 and 4,300 killed
and wounded. The Russians left 704 dead on the field at
Nanshan Hill alone—the bodies being buried by the Japanese
some two weeks later (June 12). Altogether the Russian
total loss in killed and wounded was 2,600. The
Japanese reported the capture (during the Kinchow and
Nanshan Hill engagements and in the minor engagements
that were taking place simultaneously), of 600 prisoners, 21
guns, 1,000 rifles, and 350,000 rounds of ammunition. This
great victory was the first of the many to be celebrated in
Japan with joyful popular demonstrations.</p>

<p>On May 30th, the Japanese attacked and defeated 2,000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span>
Cossacks at Ai-pien-men; and on the same day, General Oku,
commanding the Japanese Second Army, reported to his
Government that he had occupied the port of Dalny, which
the Russians had evacuated after destroying a large part of
the town. General Oku reported, however, that the docks,
piers, and railroad station, were not seriously damaged.</p>

<p>Meanwhile (May 23 to 26), the Japanese Third Army,
under General Nodzu, engaged in a series of battles with the
Russian forces (under General Fock) which General Stoessel
had sent out from Port Arthur to attempt to restore the line
of communication between the besieged city and Mukden.</p>

<p>Fifty thousand men of General Oku’s Second Army
caught a large body of Russians under General Stakelberg
in ambush, near Telissu, on June 14th, and a battle ensued
in which the Russians lost 4,300 men and the Japanese 1,100.
Thus the Japanese thwarted one more attempt of the Russians
to move to the relief of Port Arthur, General Stakelberg
having concentrated his troops on the line of railroad
leading to the besieged city. The Russians now fell back
upon Kaiping, but the Japanese drove them from that position,
July 9th. Meantime, the Third Army under General
Nodzu had effected a junction with Kuroki, and together the
two armies advanced to Sunachen and there again defeated
the Russians, after a two hours’ battle. A Fourth Japanese
Army had taken the field, and Field Marshal Oyama was
placed in supreme command of all Japanese operations.</p>

<p>Now came another notable defeat of the Russians. In
a desperate attempt to prevent the separation of their forces,
20,000 Russians, under General Keller, unsuccessfully attacked
the Japanese at Fenshiuling (July 17), and then
retired to a strong position on the Yantze Pass. On July
23d, General Oku advanced to the attack on Yinkow, and
compelled the Russians to abandon the place. Furthermore,
on July 31st, the Japanese, after a desperate fight,
drove the Russians under General Keller from their position
on Yantze Pass. General Keller was killed and his men fell
back to Liaoyang. Simultaneously, Generals Oku and Nodzu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span>
combined in an attack on the Russians at Haicheng (August
2), compelling the enemy to evacuate that place also. Thus
with a loss of 2,400 men, the Japanese had within a few
days driven the enemy back from the mountains into the
Manchu Plains.</p>

<p>With 200,000 men the Japanese then renewed the attack
on the Russians (who had 148,000 men), at Liaoyang. The
First, Second and Third Armies began a general advance
(August 26), and continued to push forward till September
3d, when the Russians were driven out of Liaoyang and
compelled to retreat toward Mukden. By September 5th
the Russian forces under General Kuropatkin were practically
surrounded by the Japanese.</p>

<p>In October occurred one of the greatest battles of the
war, that of the Sha River and Lone Tree Hill. This time
the Russians took the offensive, advancing, 300,000 strong,
upon the Japanese battle line along the Sha River. For a
week, fighting night and day, the battle continued, the Japanese
losing their commanding position on Lone Tree Hill.
This battle also checked the Japanese advance and ended the
campaign for the fall and winter. In this seven days’ fight
each side lost about 45,000 killed and wounded.</p>

<p>Fighting was resumed on January 25, 1905, when the
Russians again took the initiative, General Kuropatkin, with
400,000 men, ordering a general attack on the enemy near
Liaoyang. For six days the battle lasted, with desperate
fighting on both sides, but resulting in the repulse of the Russians.
Then, from February 20th to March 15th, was fought
the series of terrific engagements known as the battle of
Mukden. Field Marshal Oyama’s four armies, consisting
of 500,000 men, extending in line-of-battle over a semicircle
120 miles long, advanced in a general attack which resulted
in the taking of Mukden on March 10th and the demoralized
retreat of the Russians, March 15th. In these operations
the Japanese lost 60,000 men, the Russians 100,000.</p>

<p>At Port Arthur the siege continued with a number of
aggressive movements by the Japanese who, by assault, began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span>
taking the inner forts on August 21st. Ten days later a
general assault, directed by General Nogi, was made on the
city, but was repulsed. On September 24th the Japanese
captured the forts commanding the water supply of the city.
On November 4th, the Japanese took Wantai Hill, and on
November 30th captured 203-Metre Hill commanding city
and harbor. Fight after fight took place until January 2,
1905, when the capitulation of the city became an accomplished
fact, General Stoessel surrendering to General Nogi.
After this most notable siege of modern history, in which the
Japanese gained the richest prize of the war (Port Arthur
being the key to the situation on land), the reckoning showed
that the Japanese lost three times as many men as the enemy—45,000
on the Japanese side, while the Russian losses were
only 15,000.</p>

<p>On the sea, at the same time, Japanese operations resulted
in still more brilliant victories. On April 13, 1904, the
Russian battleship <i>Petropavlovsk</i>, returning to Port Arthur
harbor with Admiral Makaroff on board, struck a mine (or
possibly a torpedo), and sank, the Russian admiral and 600
of the crew of the battleship losing their lives. In May the
Japanese bombarded Vladivostok, and, by sinking merchant
vessels at the entrance to Port Arthur harbor, attempted to
bottle up the Russian squadron. On May 11th the Japanese
lost a cruiser that was torpedoed off Port Arthur; and on the
17th lost two more warships, one by a mine and the other by
collision. Naval fights occurred during the summer and fall,
usually with decided success for the ships of the Mikado.
On December 6th, having captured 203-Metre Hill, the Japanese
shelled the Russian fleet in the harbor, sinking a turret-ship
and a battleship, and seriously damaging other vessels,
thus rendering Russia helpless in naval operations in those
waters.</p>

<p>However, the Russian Baltic Sea fleet, under Admiral
Rojestvensky, was on the way to the East; and upon this fleet
now were centred all Russian hopes of regaining even partial
control on the Far Eastern seas. But Admiral Togo, commanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[414]</span>
the Japanese naval forces, was lying in wait off
Tsu Island, in the east channel of Corea Strait, and no
sooner did Rojestvensky’s fleet arrive (after junction with
a smaller squadron under Admiral Nebogatoff) than Togo
steamed forward to deliver a crushing blow that was to
end the war and to bring Togo everlasting fame. Togo
signaled to his vessels: “The destiny of our Empire depends
upon this action. You are all expected to do your utmost.”
That was at noon, May 27, 1905. All that afternoon and all
the following day the fighting continued, resulting in the
practical annihilation of the Russian fleet—all the best remaining
ships of the Russian navy being sunk. Admiral Rojestvensky
was taken prisoner; Admiral Nebogatoff surrendered
his squadron. Admiral Togo sank six battleships,
six cruisers, a coast-defense vessel, a repair ship, and a number
of destroyers, while on his own very slightly damaged
vessels there were less than 1,000 casualties.</p>

<p>Ten days later (June 8, 1905), Theodore Roosevelt,
President of the United States, intervened to end the war.
Addressing the Japanese and Russian Governments, Mr.
Roosevelt urged immediate and direct peace negotiations and
offered his friendly services. Both the belligerent nations
accepted the President’s offer (June 12) and plenipotentiaries
were at once appointed to discuss the terms of peace. Baron
Komura and Mr. Takahira representing Japan, and Baron
Rosen and Count Witte representing Russia, were introduced
to one another on the President’s yacht, <i>Mayflower</i>, at Oyster
Bay, Long Island, August 5th. The envoys were then conveyed
to the Navy Yard at Portsmouth, New Hampshire,
where the sessions of the peace conference continued for
thirty days, the Treaty of Portsmouth being signed on
September 5th.</p>

<p>By the terms of this treaty, Japan secured from Russia
“not one kopek,” as Count Witte expressed it, for war indemnity.
Japan gained, however, a recognition of her preponderant
influence in Corea and an agreement by Russia to
evacuate Manchuria and to return to China the civil administration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[415]</span>
of Manchurian territory. Also Japan acquired Russia’s
leasehold of Port Arthur, the holding of all military
works at Port Arthur and Dalny, and the control of the
Chinese Eastern Railway. Finally, Japan secured from
Russia the cession of one-half of the island of Sakhalin,
Japan taking the half nearest to her own islands (the southern
half) while Russia retained the northern half.</p>

<p>These terms, however, wore unsatisfactory to the Japanese
people—especially the failure to secure any indemnity—the
people feeling that they should have received more for
their sacrifices made during the war. Riotous demonstrations
against the Government broke out in Tokio and elsewhere,
but were quelled after the placing of Tokio under
martial law.</p>

<p>In the reckoning of grand totals of forces engaged and
men lost in the war, it was estimated that Japan had over
1,200,000 troops in the field, and that her losses in killed
and wounded, and from disease, amounted to 370,000.
Russia had only 870,000 men actually in the field, though
her available force in the East was over 1,000,000 men.
Russian field casualties were estimated at 350,000.</p>

<p>Three weeks after the signing of the Treaty of Portsmouth,
Japan renewed her Treaty of Alliance with Great
Britain (September 27, 1905), to remain in force for ten
years. By the terms of this treaty both countries agreed to
maintain peace in Eastern Asia and India and to respect the
integrity of China; England agreed, also, to recognize Japan’s
paramount political, military, and economic interests in
Corea.</p>

<p>On December 28, 1905, the Emperor of Japan opened
the first Diet following the war and the new Alliance Treaty
with England, referring in his speech to the fact that Japan
had become a world power and that it was the duty of Parliament
and of all citizens to assist to the utmost in fulfilling
the country’s newly acquired obligations.</p>

<p>A new Cabinet was then formed with Marquis Saionji
as Premier. Through the two years following, during which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[416]</span>
the Marquis was in power, the country was agitated by a
succession of popular demonstrations against the Government,
the people declaring that the nation’s finances were not properly
administered and that taxation had increased “beyond
tolerance.” The crisis in the financial situation was reached
on January 14, 1908, when Marquis Saionji tendered his
resignation, only to have it refused by the Emperor, his
Majesty asserting that the Premier’s policies possessed
his entire confidence.</p>

<p>On January 19th, the Progressive Party of Japan
adopted a platform attacking the Cabinet for “bad finance and
weak diplomacy.” And as late as March 21, 1908, figures
presented to the House of Peers showed the necessity for an
increase in taxes to meet deficits. This additional drain on
the popular pocketbook resulted in disturbances and even
sanguinary riots in May of 1908.</p>

<p>A supplementary treaty with Russia, known as the Russo-Japanese
Convention, signed July 30, 1907, strengthened
the diplomatic friendship that was re-established between
Japan and her erstwhile enemy by the Treaty of Portsmouth.
By the terms of the new Convention, the contracting
nations agreed each to respect the existing territorial
integrity of the other. Both recognized the independence
and territorial integrity of China and the principle of equal
opportunities in commerce and industry of all nations in the
Chinese Empire. Also the Convention provided for a linking
of the Japanese and Russian railways in Manchuria.</p>

<p>Japanese control in Corea was completed, indeed, only
after a series of wordy conflicts with the Corean Emperor and
his Ministry, and after a number of riots throughout Corea
that had to be put down by Japanese troops with much
shedding of blood.</p>

<p>Soon after the opening of hostilities between Japan and
Russia, an agreement between the Mikado’s representative
and the Corean Emperor was signed (February 23, 1904),
whereby Corea adopted the advice of Japan in respect to various
improvements in administration, while Japan insured the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[417]</span>
safety of the Imperial Household of Corea and guaranteed
the independence and territorial integrity of the Corean Empire.
By this agreement, Japan secured the assistance of the
Corean army in movements in Corea.</p>

<p>A second agreement between Japan and Corea, signed
August 22, 1904, provided for a Japanese Financial Adviser
and a Foreign Diplomatic Adviser to regulate the Corean
finances and foreign relations.</p>

<p>On November 18, 1905, two months after the signing of
the Treaty of Portsmouth, occurred the formal transfer to
Japan of the control of the Corean Government. This transfer
was in accordance with a treaty signed the day before, at
Seoul, whereby it was provided that Japan should control and
direct the external relations and affairs of Corea, through the
Japanese Department of Foreign Affairs in Tokio. It was
also agreed that Japan should have direct representation at
the Court of the Emperor of Corea by a Resident-General
residing at Seoul. Count Ito, of Tokio, was appointed to this
post; and, acting under the terms of the treaty, he at once
stationed Japanese Residents (or local governors) at the several
open ports of Corea and at other places in Corea.</p>

<p>From the beginning of Japanese control, the attitude of
the Emperor of Corea toward the Mikado’s representatives
was one of active opposition and at times even of open
hostility. The secret plottings of the disgruntled Emperor
against the Japanese authorities reached their culminating
act in the spring of 1907, when he sent a delegation, with
more or less secrecy, to the Hague Peace Conference. This
led to his abdication in favor of the Crown Prince, July 19,
1907. Coreans asserted that the abdication was compulsory.
The facts, as given officially, however, show that the Emperor
abdicated by unanimous advice of his Ministers.</p>

<p>With the accession to the throne of the new Emperor, a
new Convention was promulgated (July 25), in which the
future course of Japanese control was defined and agreed to
by his Corean Majesty, as follows: First, the administration
of the Corean Government was to be under the Japanese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[418]</span>
Resident-General, Count Ito; second, all transactions of important
state affairs, as well as the enactment of all laws, were
to receive the approval of the Resident-General before going
into effect; third, all appointments of high executive officials
were to receive the approval of the Resident-General; fourth,
Japanese subjects, if recommended by the Resident-General,
were to be eligible to hold office under the Corean Government;
fifth, no foreigners were to be employed by the Corean
Government excepting with the consent of the Resident-General.</p>

<p>After the signing of this Convention, the Corean army
was disbanded. By May 2, 1908, cordial relations between
the new Emperor and the Japanese Resident-General had
progressed to such an extent that the Corean Government
itself began an active campaign against the disorderly elements
throughout the Empire.</p>

<p>Relations between the Governments of Japan and the
United States continued undisturbed through the first three
years following the close of the Russo-Japanese War, though
at one time, in 1907, the press and people both in Japan and
the United States went so far as to discuss the possibility of
war between the two countries. The rumors of war were the
outgrowth, first, of the act of the authorities of San Francisco,
California, in barring Japanese pupils from the regular public
schools; second, of the agitation in the United States to
restrict Japanese immigration; third, of the decision of the
United States Government to send a great fleet of battleships,
for the first time in history, to the Pacific; fourth, of attacks
on Japanese subjects at San Francisco and other places on the
Pacific Coast.</p>

<p>While barring Japanese pupils from the regular schools,
the authorities of San Francisco proposed that a separate
Oriental School be maintained for Japanese, on the ground
that the Japanese “schoolboys” were, many of them, grown
men and that they corrupted the morals of the white pupils.
President Roosevelt sent Secretary of the Navy Metcalf to
make a thorough investigation and, upon receiving his report,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[419]</span>
requested that the San Francisco officials abandon the idea of
a separate school for Orientals and that Japanese pupils be
readmitted to the regular public schools. San Francisco
agreed to this, on condition that the United States Government
take immediate measures to restrict further immigration
of Japanese from Hawaii, the Philippines, Canada,
Mexico, and Panama.</p>

<p>Meantime, popular demonstrations against the Japanese
had taken place at various cities on the Pacific Coast. In San
Francisco, especially, stores and other places of business conducted
by Japanese were wrecked and the owners and employees
thereof attacked. Action taken by the authorities to
punish the offenders led to rioting and still further attacks on
the Japanese. The result was a formal protest from the Japanese
Government demanding protection for Japanese subjects
in California. Thereupon the Federal Government at
Washington announced that it would “proceed to use every
available means, civil and military, to protect aliens.” Attacks
on the Japanese occurred at intervals, nevertheless,
until well into 1908, when peace was seemingly restored.</p>

<p>In December, 1907, while the anti-Japanese feeling on
the Pacific Coast of the United States ran highest, the Japanese
Government received proposals from the United States
Government in regard to restricting immigration. To these
restrictions the Japanese Government agreed (December 31),
and in February, 1908, the matter was closed by an agreement
signed by Japan to supervise future immigration to the
United States in accordance with the restrictions agreed upon.</p>

<p>The attitude of the Japanese people in regard to the visit
of the United States fleet to the Pacific Coast was at first
one of mild alarm and resentment. Altogether different was
the attitude of official Japan. So far was the Japanese Government
from resenting the movement of the fleet that a
formal invitation was sent to President Roosevelt inviting
the United States ships of war to visit Japan. This invitation
was accepted March 20, 1908. In June the fleet, then
on the Pacific Coast of the United States, was making preparations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[420]</span>
for the long voyage to Japanese waters and thence
around the world. And in proof of the cordial reception accorded
to Americans and American wares in Japan, the Government
at Tokio (April 1, 1908), published a report
containing figures showing that the United States led the
nations of the world in trade with Japan. Moreover, a general
Arbitration Treaty between Japan and the United States
was signed at Washington, May 5, 1908.</p>

<p>Prince Fushimi, adopted brother of the Mikado, arrived
in the United States in November, 1904, calling on President
Roosevelt on the 15th. The reception accorded the Prince in
Washington and other American cities gave great satisfaction
in Japan, as did also the manner in which he was received in
Canada and England, which countries he visited after leaving
the United States.</p>

<p>Japanese-Chinese relations continued on a basis of uninterrupted
cordiality following the close of the Russo-Japanese
War, until early in 1908, when, in the Chinese harbor of
Macao, Chinese officials seized a Japanese merchant steamer,
the <i>Tatsu Maru</i>, a large part of the cargo of which consisted
of arms and munitions of war. The seizure immediately
created a sensation throughout both Empires. Japan, on
February 29th, demanded an apology and an indemnity from
China for the seizure. On March 14th China returned the
vessel to Japan and agreed to pay an indemnity, though she
retained the arms found on board. The release of the ship
caused widespread indignation among the Chinese, who in
vengeance started, in March, a boycott against the Japanese
that lasted until June, though Japan meanwhile formally requested
the Chinese authorities to suppress the boycott.</p>

<p>Japan needed, of course, a confirmation from China of the
transfer by Russia to Japan of the Chinese Eastern Railway,
and of the lease of Port Arthur and the Liau-tung Peninsula,
in accordance with the Treaty of Portsmouth. Accordingly,
a Convention between the two countries was signed January
22, 1906—thus completing the final move in securing to
Japan her prizes won in the war.</p>

here. It is called by the natives literally to “cut the belly.”
The name “happy dispatch” seems to have been a felicitous
suggestion of some foreigner. It is said to be done by a cut
across the abdomen, and sometimes another cut is said to be
made in the form of a cross. But any one who knows anything
of the subject will think this nearly an impossibility,
from the extreme difficulty of making the two other cuts
necessary to make a cross. This would be a very butchering
and trying job, and would bring on only a lingering
death. So far as can be judged from the way it is performed
in theaters, the knife, a short well-sharpened instrument,
is inserted into the abdomen, and then drawn across
the backbone, so as to sever the great blood-vessels, the aorta
and ascending vein, which are there of such a size as to allow
of death from their division in a few seconds. There seems
to be no drawing across the abdomen. What is called swallowing
gold leaf in China is in reality inhaling it when rubbed
to a sort of flaky powder. It seems to choke the air-vessels,
and so produce suffocation.</p>
